D&C 25:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, July 1830. --The word of the Lord directed to Emma Smith, the Prophet's wive--Her duties defined, and glorious possibilities of achievement set forth--The Lord's admonitions are applied to all.

D&C 25:1 Hearken unto the voice of the Lord your God, while I speak unto you, Emma Smith, my daughter; for verily I say unto you, all those who receive my gospel are sons and daughters in my kingdom.

D&C 25:2 A revelation I give unto you concerning my will; and if thou art faithful and walk in the paths of virtue before me, I will preserve thy life, and thou shalt receive an inheritance in Zion.

D&C 25:3 Behold, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou art an elect lady, whom I have called.

D&C 25:4 Murmur not because of the things which thou hast not seen, for they are withheld from thee and from the world, which is wisdom in me in a time to come.

D&C 25:5 And the office of thy calling shall be for a comfort unto my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., thy husband, in his afflictions, with consoling words, in the spirit of meekness.

D&C 25:6 And thou shalt go with him at the time of his going, and be unto him for a scribe, while there is no one to be a scribe for him, that I may send my servant, Oliver Cowdery, whithersoever I will.

D&C 25:7 And thou shalt be ordained under his hand to expound scriptures, and to exhort the church, according as it shall be given thee by my Spirit.

D&C 25:8 For he shall lay his hands upon thee, and thou shalt receive the Holy Ghost, and thy time shall be given to writing, and to learning much.

D&C 25:9 And thou needest not fear, for thy husband shall support thee in the church; for unto them is his calling, that all things might be revealed unto them, whatsoever I will, according to their faith.

D&C 25:10 And verily I say unto thee that thou shalt lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better.

D&C 25:11 And it shall be given thee, also, to make a selection of sacred hymns, as it shall be given thee, which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church.

D&C 25:12 For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.

D&C 25:13 Wherefore, lift up thy heart and rejoice, and cleave unto the covenants which thou hast made.

D&C 25:14 Continue in the spirit of meekness, and beware of pride. Let thy soul delight in thy husband, and the glory which shall come upon him.

D&C 25:15 Keep my commandments continually, and a crown of righteousness thou shalt receive. And except thou do this, where I am you cannot come.

D&C 25:16 And verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my voice unto all. Amen.

D&C 26:0 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, Oliver Cowdery, and John Whitmer, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, July, 1830. --Instructions as to immediate duty--Reaffirmation of the principle of common consent in Church affairs.

D&C 26:1 Behold, I say unto you that you shall let your time be devoted to the studying of the scriptures, and to preaching, and to confirming the church at Colesville, and to performing your labors on the land, such as is required, until after you shall go to the west to hold the next conference; and then it shall be made known what you shall do.

D&C 26:2 And all things shall be done by common consent in the church, by much prayer and faith, for all things you shall receive by faith. Amen.

D&C 27:0 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, August, 1830. In preparation for a religious service at which the sacrament of bread and wine was to be administered, Joseph set out to procure wine for the occasion. He was met by a heavenly messenger, and received this revelation, the first four paragraphs of which were written at the time, and the remainder in the September following. Water is commonly used instead of wine in the sacramental services of the Church. --Warning against the use of wine of unassured purity in the sacrament--Many ancient prophets named, with whom, as with the latter-day prophets, the Lord promises to partake at a time yet to come--The prior ordination of Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery to the Apostleship avowed--Encouraging admonition given.

D&C 27:1 Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Lord, your God, and your Redeemer, whose word is quick and powerful.

D&C 27:2 For, behold, I say unto you, that it mattereth not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my glory--remembering unto the Father my body which was laid down for you, and my blood which was shed for the remission of your sins.

D&C 27:3 Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, that you shall not purchase wine neither strong drink of your enemies;

D&C 27:4 Wherefore, you shall partake of none except it is made new among you; yea, in this my Father's kingdom which shall be built up on the earth.

D&C 27:5 Behold, this is wisdom in me; wherefore, marvel not, for the hour cometh that I will drink of the fruit of the vine with you on the earth, and with Moroni, whom I have sent unto you to reveal the Book of Mormon, containing the fulness of my everlasting gospel, to whom I have committed the keys of the record of the stick of Ephraim;

D&C 27:6 And also with Elias, to whom I have committed the keys of bringing to pass the restoration of all things spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began, concerning the last days;

D&C 27:7 And also John the son of Zacharias, which Zacharias he (Elias) visited and gave promise that he should have a son, and his name should be John, and he should be filled with the spirit of Elias;

D&C 27:8 Which John I have sent unto you, my servants, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery, to ordain you unto the first priesthood which you have received, that you might be called and ordained even as Aaron;

D&C 27:9 And also Elijah, unto whom I have committed the keys of the power of turning the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, that the whole earth may not be smitten with a curse;

D&C 27:10 And also with Joseph and Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham, your fathers, by whom the promises remain;

D&C 27:11 And also with Michael, or Adam, the father of all, the prince of all, the ancient of days;

D&C 27:12 And also with Peter, and James, and John, whom I have sent unto you, by whom I have ordained you and confirmed you to be apostles, and especial witnesses of my name, and bear the keys of your ministry and of the same things which I revealed unto them;

D&C 27:13 Unto whom I have committed the keys of my kingdom, and a dispensation of the gospel for the last times; and for the fulness of times, in the which I will gather together in one all things, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth;

D&C 27:14 And also with all those whom my Father hath given me out of the world.

D&C 27:15 Wherefore, lift up your hearts and rejoice, and gird up your loins, and take upon you my whole armor, that ye may be able to withstand the evil day, having done all, that ye may be able to stand.

D&C 27:16 Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, which I have sent mine angels to commit unto you;

D&C 27:17 Taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked;

D&C 27:18 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of my Spirit, which I will pour out upon you, and my word which I reveal unto you, and be agreed as touching all things whatsoever ye ask of me, and be faithful until I come, and ye shall be caught up, that where I am ye shall be also. Amen.

D&C 28:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to Oliver Cowdery, at Fayette, New York, September, 1830. Hiram Page, a member of the Church, had a certain stone, and professed to be receiving revelations by its aid concerning the upbuilding of Zion and the order of the Church. Several members had been deceived by these claims, and even Oliver Cowdery was wrongly influenced thereby. Just prior to an appointed conference, the Prophet inquired earnestly of the Lord concerning the matter and this revelation followed. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 109. --Joseph's position of presidency defined--Oliver warned against undue assumption--Oliver's mission to the Lamanites stated--He to labor with Hiram Page, whom Satan had deceived--Hiram Page not appointed by the Lord nor accepted by the people as a revelator to the Church.

D&C 28:1 Behold, I say unto thee, Oliver, that it shall be given unto thee that thou shalt be heard by the church in all things whatsoever thou shalt teach them by the Comforter, concerning the revelations and commandments which I have given.

D&C 28:2 But, behold, verily, verily, I say unto thee, no one shall be appointed to receive commandments and revelations in this church excepting my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., for he receiveth them even as Moses.

D&C 28:3 And thou shalt be obedient unto the things which I shall give unto him, even as Aaron, to declare faithfully the commandments and the revelations, with power and authority unto the church.

D&C 28:4 And if thou art led at any time by the Comforter to speak or teach, or at all times by the way of commandment unto the church, thou mayest do it.

D&C 28:5 But thou shalt not write by way of commandment, but by wisdom;

D&C 28:6 And thou shalt not command him who is at thy head, and at the head of the church;

D&C 28:7 For I have given him the keys of the mysteries, and the revelations which are sealed, until I shall appoint unto them another in his stead.

D&C 28:8 And now, behold, I say unto you that you shall go unto the Lamanites and preach my gospel unto them; and inasmuch as they receive thy teachings thou shalt cause my church to be established among them; and thou shalt have revelations, but write them not by way of commandment.

D&C 28:9 And now, behold, I say unto you that it is not revealed, and no man knoweth where the city Zion shall be built, but it shall be given hereafter. Behold, I say unto you that it shall be on the borders by the Lamanites.

D&C 28:10 Thou shalt not leave this place until after the conference; and my servant Joseph shall be appointed to preside over the conference by the voice of it, and what he saith to thee thou shalt tell.

D&C 28:11 And again, thou shalt take thy brother, Hiram Page, between him and thee alone, and tell him that those things which he hath written from that stone are not of me and that Satan deceiveth him;

D&C 28:12 For, behold, these things have not been appointed unto him, neither shall anything be appointed unto any of this church contrary to the church covenants.

D&C 28:13 For all things must be done in order, and by common consent in the church, by the prayer of faith.

D&C 28:14 And thou shalt assist to settle all these things, according to the covenants of the church, before thou shalt take thy journey among the Lamanites.

D&C 28:15 And it shall be given thee from the time thou shalt go, until the time thou shalt return, what thou shalt do.

D&C 28:16 And thou must open thy mouth at all times, declaring my gospel with the sound of rejoicing. Amen.

D&C 29:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, in the presence of six Elders, at Fayette, New York, September, 1830. This revelation was given some days prior to the conference beginning September 26, 1830. --The gathering of the elect specified--The imminence of the Lord's advent affirmed--Calamities incident to the sinful state of the world--the Millennium and scenes of judgment to follow--Distinction between the spiritual and temporal creations--Purpose of the mortal probation--The agency of man--the assured redemption of children who die in infancy.

D&C 29:1 Listen to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, the Great I AM, whose arm of mercy hath atoned for your sins;

D&C 29:2 Who will gather his people even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, even as many as will hearken to my voice and humble themselves before me, and call upon me in mighty prayer.

D&C 29:3 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that at this time your sins are forgiven you, therefore ye receive these things; but remember to sin no more, lest perils shall come upon you.

D&C 29:4 Verily, I say unto you that ye are chosen out of the world to declare my gospel with the sound of rejoicing, as with the voice of a trump.

D&C 29:5 Lift up your hearts and be glad, for I am in your midst, and am your advocate with the Father; and it is his good will to give you the kingdom.

D&C 29:6 And, as it is written--Whatsoever ye shall ask in faith, being united in prayer according to my command, ye shall receive.

D&C 29:7 And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts;

D&C 29:8 Wherefore the decree hath gone forth from the Father that they shall be gathered in unto one place upon the face of this land, to prepare their hearts and be prepared in all things against the day when tribulation and desolation are sent forth upon the wicked.

D&C 29:9 For the hour is nigh and the day soon at hand when the earth is ripe; and all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble; and I will burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that wickedness shall not be upon the earth;

D&C 29:10 For the hour is nigh, and that which was spoken by mine apostles must be fulfilled; for as they spoke so shall it come to pass;

D&C 29:11 For I will reveal myself from heaven with power and great glory, with all the hosts thereof, and dwell in righteousness with men on earth a thousand years, and the wicked shall not stand.

D&C 29:12 And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, and it hath gone forth in a firm decree, by the will of the Father, that mine apostles, the Twelve which were with me in my ministry at Jerusalem, shall stand at my right hand at the day of my coming in a pillar of fire, being clothed with robes of righteousness, with crowns upon their heads, in glory even as I am, to judge the whole house of Israel, even as many as have loved me and kept my commandments, and none else.

D&C 29:13 For a trump shall sound both long and loud, even as upon Mount Sinai, and all the earth shall quake, and they shall come forth--yea, even the dead which died in me, to receive a crown of righteousness, and to be clothed upon, even as I am, to be with me, that we may be one.

D&C 29:14 But, behold, I say unto you that before this great day shall come the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall be turned into blood, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and there shall be greater signs in heaven above and in the earth beneath;

D&C 29:15 And there shall be weeping and wailing among the hosts of men;

D&C 29:16 And there shall be a great hailstorm sent forth to destroy the crops of the earth.

D&C 29:17 And it shall come to pass, because of the wickedness of the world, that I will take vengeance upon the wicked, for they will not repent; for the cup of mine indignation is full; for behold, my blood shall not cleanse them if they hear me not.

D&C 29:18 Wherefore, I the Lord God will send forth flies upon the face of the earth, which shall take hold of the inhabitants thereof, and shall eat their flesh, and shall cause maggots to come in upon them;

D&C 29:19 And their tongues shall be stayed that they shall not utter against me; and their flesh shall fall from off their bones, and their eyes from their sockets;

D&C 29:20 And it shall come to pass that the beasts of the forest and the fowls of the air shall devour them up.

D&C 29:21 And the great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall be cast down by devouring fire, according as it is spoken by the mouth of Ezekiel the prophet, who spoke of these things, which have not come to pass but surely must, as I live, for abominations shall not reign.

D&C 29:22 And again, verily, verily, I say unto you that when the thousand years are ended, and men again begin to deny their God, then will I spare the earth but for a little season;

D&C 29:23 And the end shall come, and the heaven and the earth shall be consumed and pass away, and there shall be a new heaven and a new earth.

D&C 29:24 For all old things shall pass away, and all things shall become new, even the heaven and the earth, and all the fulness thereof, both men and beasts, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea;

D&C 29:25 And not one hair, neither mote, shall be lost, for it is the workmanship of mine hand.

D&C 29:26 But, behold, verily I say unto you, before the earth shall pass away, Michael, mine archangel, shall sound his trump, and then shall all the dead awake, for their graves shall be opened, and they shall come forth--yea, even all.

D&C 29:27 And the righteous shall be gathered on my right hand unto eternal life; and the wicked on my left hand will I be ashamed to own before the Father;

D&C 29:28 Wherefore I will say unto them--Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.

D&C 29:29 And now, behold, I say unto you, never at any time have I declared from mine own mouth that they should return, for where I am they cannot come, for they have no power.

D&C 29:30 But remember that all my judgments are not given unto men; and as the words have gone forth out of my mouth even so shall they be fulfilled, that the first shall be last, and that the last shall be first in all things whatsoever I have created by the word of my power, which is the power of my Spirit.

D&C 29:31 For by the power of my Spirit created I them; yea, all things both spiritual and temporal--

D&C 29:32 First spiritual, secondly temporal, which is the beginning of my work; and again, first temporal, and secondly spiritual, which is the last of my work--

D&C 29:33 Speaking unto you that you may naturally understand; but unto myself my works have no end, neither beginning; but it is given unto you that ye may understand, because ye have asked it of me and are agreed.

D&C 29:34 Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created.

D&C 29:35 Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither carnal nor sensual.

D&C 29:36 And it came to pass that Adam, being tempted of the devil--for, behold, the devil was before Adam, for he rebelled against me, saying, Give me thine honor, which is my power; and also a third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me because of their agency;

D&C 29:37 And they were thrust down, and thus came the devil and his angels;

D&C 29:38 And, behold, there is a place prepared for them from the beginning, which place is hell.

D&C 29:39 And it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet--

D&C 29:40 Wherefore, it came to pass that the devil tempted Adam, and he partook of the forbidden fruit and transgressed the commandment, wherein he became subject to the will of the devil, because he yielded unto temptation.

D&C 29:41 Wherefore, I, the Lord God, caused that he should be cast out from the Garden of Eden, from my presence, because of his transgression, wherein he became spiritually dead, which is the first death, even that same death which is the last death, which is spiritual, which shall be pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say: Depart, ye cursed.

D&C 29:42 But, behold, I say unto you that I, the Lord God, gave unto Adam and unto his seed, that they should not die as to the temporal death, until I, the Lord God, should send forth angels to declare unto them repentance and redemption, through faith on the name of mine Only Begotten Son.

D&C 29:43 And thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his probation--that by his natural death he might be raised in immortality unto eternal life, even as many as would believe;

D&C 29:44 And they that believe not unto eternal damnation; for they cannot be redeemed from their spiritual fall, because they repent not;

D&C 29:45 For they love darkness rather than light, and their deeds are evil, and they receive their wages of whom they list to obey.

D&C 29:46 But behold, I say unto you, that little children are redeemed from the foundation of the world through mine Only Begotten;

D&C 29:47 Wherefore, they cannot sin, for power is not given unto Satan to tempt little children, until they begin to become accountable before me;

D&C 29:48 For it is given unto them even as I will, according to mine own pleasure, that great things may be required at the hand of their fathers.

D&C 29:49 And, again, I say unto you, that whoso having knowledge, have I not commanded to repent?

D&C 29:50 And he that hath no understanding, it remaineth in me to do according as it is written. And now I declare no more unto you at this time. Amen.

D&C 30:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to David Whitmer, Peter Whitmer, Jun., and John Whitmer, at Fayette, New York, September, 1830, following the three day's conference at Fayette, but before the Elders of the Church had separated. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 115. --Individual instruction is given, and the fact of Oliver Cowdery's mission to

D&C 30:1 Behold, I say unto you, David, that you have feared man and have not relied on me for strength as you ought.

D&C 30:2 But your mind has been on the things of the earth more than on the things of me, your Maker, and the ministry whereunto you have been called; and you have not given heed unto my Spirit, and to those who were set over you, but have been persuaded by those whom I have not commanded.

D&C 30:3 Wherefore, you are left to inquire for yourself at my hand, and ponder upon the things which you have received.

D&C 30:4 And your home shall be at your father's house, until I give unto you further commandments. And you shall attend to the ministry in the church, and before the world, and in the regions round about. Amen.

D&C 30:5 Behold, I say unto you, Peter, that you shall take your journey with your brother Oliver; for the time has come that it is expedient in me that you shall open your mouth to declare my gospel; therefore, fear not, but give heed unto the words and advice of your brother, which he shall give you.

D&C 30:6 And be you afflicted in all his afflictions, ever lifting up your heart unto me in prayer and faith, for his and your deliverance; for I have given unto him power to build up my church among the Lamanites;

D&C 30:7 And none have I appointed to be his counselor over him in the church, concerning church matters, except it is his brother, Joseph Smith, Jun.

D&C 30:8 Wherefore, give heed unto these things and be diligent in keeping my commandments, and you shall be blessed unto eternal life. Amen.

D&C 30:9 Behold, I say unto you, my servant John, that thou shalt commence from this time forth to proclaim my gospel, as with the voice of a trump.

D&C 30:10 And your labor shall be at your brother Philip Burroughs', and in that region round about, yea, wherever you can be heard, until I command you to go from hence.

D&C 30:11 And your whole labor shall be in Zion, with all your soul, from henceforth; yea, you shall ever open your mouth in my cause, not fearing what man can do, for I am with you. Amen.

D&C 31:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to Thomas B. Marsh, September, 1830. Thomas B. Marsh had been baptized earlier in the month, and had already been ordained an Elder in the church when this revelation was given. --Commended for obedience and faithfulness--Assured as to the welfare of his family--Appointed to preach and administer--Promised the guidance of the Comforter in his ministry.

D&C 31:1 Thomas, my son, blessed are you because of your faith in my work.

D&C 31:2 Behold, you have had many afflictions because of your family; nevertheless, I will bless you and your family, yea, your little ones; and the day cometh that they will believe and know the truth and be one with you in my church.

D&C 31:3 Lift up your heart and rejoice, for the hour of your mission is come; and your tongue shall be loosed, and you shall declare glad tidings of great joy unto this generation.

D&C 31:4 You shall declare the things which have been revealed to my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun. You shall begin to preach from this time forth, yea, to reap in the field which is white already to be burned.

D&C 31:5 Therefore, thrust in your sickle with all your soul, and your sins are forgiven you, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your back, for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Wherefore, your family shall live.

D&C 31:6 Behold, verily I say unto you, go from them only for a little time, and declare my word, and I will prepare a place for them.

D&C 31:7 Yea, I will open the hearts of the people, and they will receive you. And I will establish a church by your hand;

D&C 31:8 And you shall strengthen them and prepare them against the time when they shall be gathered.

D&C 31:9 Be patient in afflictions, revile not against those that revile. Govern your house in meekness, and be steadfast.

D&C 31:10 Behold, I say unto you that you shall be a physician unto the church, but not unto the world, for they will not receive you.

D&C 31:11 Go your way whithersoever I will, and it shall be given you by the Comforter what you shall do and whither you shall go.

D&C 31:12 Pray always, lest you enter into temptation and lose your reward.

D&C 31:13 Be faithful unto the end, and lo, I am with you. These words are not of man nor of men, but of me, even Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, by the will of the Father. Amen.

D&C 32:0 Revelation Given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to Parley P. Pratt and Ziba Peterson, October, 1830. Great interest and yearning desires were felt by the Elders respecting the Lamanites, of whose predicted blessings the Church had learned from the Book of Mormon. In consequence, supplication was made that the Lord would indicate his will as to whether Elders should be sent at that time to the Indian tribes in the West. The revelation followed. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 118. --The missionaries admonished to confine themselves to the expounding of the written word, as they shall be given understanding thereof.

D&C 32:1 And now concerning my servant Parley P. Pratt, behold, I say unto him that as I live I will that he shall declare my gospel and learn of me, and be meek and lowly of heart.

D&C 32:2 And that which I have appointed unto him is that he shall go with my servants, Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer, Jun., into the wilderness among the Lamanites.

D&C 32:3 And Ziba Peterson also shall go with them; and I myself will go with them and be in their midst; and I am their advocate with the Father, and nothing shall prevail against them.

D&C 32:4 And they shall give heed to that which is written, and pretend to no other revelation; and they shall pray always that I may unfold the same to their understanding.

D&C 32:5 And they shall give heed unto these words and trifle not, and I will bless them. Amen.

D&C 33:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to Ezra Thayre and Northrop Sweet, at Fayette, New York, October, 1830. In recording this revelation the Prophet avers that the Lord is ever ready to instruct such as diligently seek in faith. --The corrupted state of the world declared--Call for laborers in the ministry--Bringing forth of the Church from the wilderness and its establishment by the Lord--Commission of the Elders to proclaim repentance and baptism--Imminence of the Lord's coming.

D&C 33:1 Behold, I say unto you, my servants Ezra and Northrop, open ye your ears and hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, whose word is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of the joints and marrow, soul and spirit; and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

D&C 33:2 For verily, verily, I say unto you that ye are called to lift up your voices as with the sound of a trump, to declare my gospel unto a crooked and perverse generation.

D&C 33:3 For behold, the field is white already to harvest; and it is the eleventh hour, and the last time that I shall call laborers into my vineyard.

D&C 33:4 And my vineyard has become corrupted every whit; and there is none which doeth good save it be a few; and they err in many instances because of priestcrafts, all having corrupt minds.

D&C 33:5 And verily, verily, I say unto you, that this church have I established and called forth out of the wilderness.

D&C 33:6 And even so will I gather mine elect from the four quarters of the earth, even as many as will believe in me, and hearken unto my voice.

D&C 33:7 Yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, that the field is white already to harvest; wherefore, thrust in your sickles, and reap with all your might, mind, and strength.

D&C 33:8 Open your mouths and they shall be filled, and you shall become even as Nephi of old, who journeyed from Jerusalem in the wilderness.

D&C 33:9 Yea, open your mouths and spare not, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your backs, for lo, I am with you.

D&C 33:10 Yea, open your mouths and they shall be filled, saying: Repent, repent, and prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand;

D&C 33:11 Yea, repent and be baptized, every one of you, for a remission of your sins; yea, be baptized even by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost.

D&C 33:12 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and remember that they shall have faith in me or they can in nowise be saved;

D&C 33:13 And upon this rock I will build my church; yea, upon this rock ye are built, and if ye continue, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.

D&C 33:14 And ye shall remember the church articles and covenants to keep them.

D&C 33:15 And whoso having faith you shall confirm in my church, by the laying on of the hands, and I will bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost upon them.

D&C 33:16 And the Book of Mormon and the holy scriptures are given of me for your instruction; and the power of my Spirit quickeneth all things.

D&C 33:17 Wherefore, be faithful, praying always, having your lamps trimmed and burning, and oil with you, that you may be ready at the coming of the Bridegroom--

D&C 33:18 For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that I come quickly. Even so. Amen.

D&C 34:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith, the Prophet, to Orson Pratt, at Fayette, New York, November 4, 1830. The recipient was nineteen years old at the time. He had been converted and baptized when he first heard the preaching of the restored Gospel by his brother, Parley P. Pratt, six weeks before. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 127. --Commended for obedience--Commanded to preach and to prophesy as the Holy Ghost shall give utterance--Certainty of the Lord's advent.

D&C 34:1 My son Orson, hearken and hear and behold what I, the Lord God, shall say unto you, even Jesus Christ your Redeemer;

D&C 34:2 The light and the life of the world, a light which shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not;

D&C 34:3 Who so loved the world that he gave his own life, that as many as would believe might become the sons of God. Wherefore you are my son;

D&C 34:4 And blessed are you because you have believed;

D&C 34:5 And more blessed are you because you are called of me to preach my gospel--

D&C 34:6 To lift up your voice as with the sound of a trump, both long and loud, and cry repentance unto a crooked and perverse generation, preparing the way of the Lord for his second coming.

D&C 34:7 For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, the time is soon at hand that I shall come in a cloud with power and great glory.

D&C 34:8 And it shall be a great day at the time of my coming, for all nations shall tremble.

D&C 34:9 But before that great day shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into blood; and the stars shall refuse their shining, and some shall fall, and great destructions await the wicked.

D&C 34:10 Wherefore, lift up your voice and spare not, for the Lord God hath spoken; therefore prophesy, and it shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.

D&C 34:11 And if you are faithful, behold, I am with you until I come--

D&C 34:12 And verily, verily, I say unto you, I come quickly. I am your Lord and your Redeemer. Even so. Amen.

D&C 35:0 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Sidney Rigdon, December, 1830. As a preface to his record of this revelation the Prophet wrote: In December Sidney Rigdon came to inquire of the Lord, and with him came Edward Partridge; the latter was a pattern of piety, and one of the Lord's great men. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 128. --How men may become sons of God--Sidney is promised that through him the Holy Ghost shall be given, as by the Apostles of old--Directed to assist the Prophet Joseph, and assured of the eventual redemption of Israel.

D&C 35:1 Listen to the voice of the Lord your God, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, whose course is one eternal round, the same today as yesterday, and forever.

D&C 35:2 I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was crucified for the sins of the world, even as many as will believe on my name, that they may become the sons of God, even one in me as I am one in the Father, as the Father is one in me, that we may be one.

D&C 35:3 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto my servant Sidney, I have looked upon thee and thy works. I have heard thy prayers, and prepared thee for a greater work.

D&C 35:4 Thou art blessed, for thou shalt do great things. Behold thou wast sent forth, even as John, to prepare the way before me, and before Elijah which should come, and thou knewest it not.

D&C 35:5 Thou didst baptize by water unto repentance, but they received not the Holy Ghost;

D&C 35:6 But now I give unto thee a commandment, that thou shalt baptize by water, and they shall receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, even as the apostles of old.

D&C 35:7 And it shall come to pass that there shall be a great work in the land, even among the Gentiles, for their folly and their abominations shall be made manifest in the eyes of all people.

D&C 35:8 For I am God, and mine arm is not shortened; and I will show miracles, signs, and wonders, unto all those who believe on my name.

D&C 35:9 And whoso shall ask it in my name in faith, they shall cast out devils; they shall heal the sick; they shall cause the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak, and the lame to walk.

D&C 35:10 And the time speedily cometh that great things are to be shown forth unto the children of men;

D&C 35:11 But without faith shall not anything be shown forth except desolations upon Babylon, the same which has made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

D&C 35:12 And there are none that doeth good except those who are ready to receive the fulness of my gospel, which I have sent forth unto this generation.

D&C 35:13 Wherefore, I call upon the weak things of the world, those who are unlearned and despised, to thrash the nations by the power of my Spirit;

D&C 35:14 And their arm shall be my arm, and I will be their shield and their buckler; and I will gird up their loins, and they shall fight manfully for me; and their enemies shall be under their feet; and I will let fall the sword in their behalf, and by the fire of mine indignation will I preserve them.

D&C 35:15 And the poor and the meek shall have the gospel preached unto them, and they shall be looking forth for the time of my coming, for it is nigh at hand--

D&C 35:16 And they shall learn the parable of the fig-tree, for even now already summer is nigh.

D&C 35:17 And I have sent forth the fulness of my gospel by the hand of my servant Joseph; and in weakness have I blessed him;

D&C 35:18 And I have given unto him the keys of the mystery of those things which have been sealed, even things which were from the foundation of the world, and the things which shall come from this time until the time of my coming, if he abide in me, and if not, another will I plant in his stead.

D&C 35:19 Wherefore, watch over him that his faith fail not, and it shall be given by the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, that knoweth all things.

D&C 35:20 And a commandment I give unto thee--that thou shalt write for him; and the scriptures shall be given, even as they are in mine own bosom, to the salvation of mine own elect;

D&C 35:21 For they will hear my voice, and shall see me, and shall not be asleep, and shall abide the day of my coming; for they shall be purified, even as I am pure.

D&C 35:22 And now I say unto you, tarry with him, and he shall journey with you; forsake him not, and surely these things shall be fulfilled.

D&C 35:23 And inasmuch as ye do not write, behold, it shall be given unto him to prophesy; and thou shalt preach my gospel and call on the holy prophets to prove his words, as they shall be given him.

D&C 35:24 Keep all the commandments and covenants by which ye are bound; and I will cause the heavens to shake for your good, and Satan shall tremble and Zion shall rejoice upon the hills and flourish;

D&C 35:25 And Israel shall be saved in mine own due time; and by the keys which I have given shall they be led, and no more be confounded at all.

D&C 35:26 Lift up your hearts and be glad, your redemption draweth nigh.

D&C 35:27 Fear not, little flock, the kingdom is yours until I come. Behold, I come quickly. Even so. Amen.

D&C 36:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to Edward Partridge, December, 1830. See heading to Section 35. --The recipient instructed to preach--Every man may be commissioned in the ministry if he will comply with the Lord's requirements.

D&C 36:1 Thus saith the Lord God, the Mighty One of Israel: Behold, I say unto you, my servant Edward, that you are blessed, and your sins are forgiven you, and you are called to preach my gospel as with the voice of a trump;

D&C 36:2 And I will lay my hand upon you by the hand of my servant Sidney Rigdon, and you shall receive my Spirit, the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which shall teach you the peaceable things of the kingdom;

D&C 36:3 And you shall declare it with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna, blessed be the name of the most high God.

D&C 36:4 And now this calling and commandment give I unto you concerning all men--

D&C 36:5 That as many as shall come before my servants Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith, Jun., embracing this calling and commandment, shall be ordained and sent forth to preach the everlasting gospel among the nations--

D&C 36:6 Crying repentance, saying: Save yourselves from this untoward generation, and come forth out of the fire, hating even the garments spotted with the flesh.

D&C 36:7 And this commandment shall be given unto the elders of my church, that every man which will embrace it with singleness of heart may be ordained and sent forth, even as I have spoken.

D&C 36:8 I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God; wherefore, gird up your loins and I will suddenly come to my temple. Even so. Amen.

D&C 37:0 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Sidney Rigdon, December, 1830. Herein is given the first commandment respecting gathering in this dispensation. --The future migration of the Church westward--Duties of the Elders in strengthening the Church.

D&C 37:1 Behold, I say unto you that it is not expedient in me that ye should translate any more until ye shall go to the Ohio, and this because of the enemy and for your sakes.

D&C 37:2 And again, I say unto you that ye shall not go until ye have preached my gospel in those parts, and have strengthened up the church whithersoever it is found, and more especially in Colesville; for, behold, they pray unto me in much faith.

D&C 37:3 And again, a commandment I give unto the church, that it is expedient in me that they should assemble together at the Ohio, against the time that my servant Oliver Cowdery shall return unto them.

D&C 37:4 Behold, here is wisdom, and let every man choose for himself until I come. Even so. Amen.

D&C 38:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Fayette, New York, January 2, 1831, at a conference of the Church. --Jesus Christ proclaims himself as the Creator--Doom of the wicked depicted--Goodly inheritance promised to the righteous--Definite promise of endowment with power from on high--The riches of eternity extolled--Diligent service required of every member of the Church.

D&C 38:1 Thus saith the Lord your God, even Jesus Christ, the Great I AM, Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the same which looked upon the wide expanse of eternity, and all the seraphic hosts of heaven, before the world was made;

D&C 38:2 The same which knoweth all things, for all things are present before mine eyes;

D&C 38:3 I am the same which spake, and the world was made, and all things came by me.

D&C 38:4 I am the same which have taken the Zion of Enoch into mine own bosom; and verily, I say, even as many as have believed in my name, for I am Christ, and in mine own name, by the virtue of the blood which I have spilt, have I pleaded before the Father for them.

D&C 38:5 But behold, the residue of the wicked have I kept in chains of darkness until the judgment of the great day, which shall come at the end of the earth;

D&C 38:6 And even so will I cause the wicked to be kept, that will not hear my voice but harden their hearts, and wo, wo, wo, is their doom.

D&C 38:7 But behold, verily, verily, I say unto you that mine eyes are upon you. I am in your midst and ye cannot see me;

D&C 38:8 But the day soon cometh that ye shall see me, and know that I am; for the veil of darkness shall soon be rent, and he that is not purified shall not abide the day.

D&C 38:9 Wherefore, gird up your loins and be prepared. Behold, the kingdom is yours, and the enemy shall not overcome.

D&C 38:10 Verily I say unto you, ye are clean, but not all; and there is none else with whom I am well pleased;

D&C 38:11 For all flesh is corrupted before me; and the powers of darkness prevail upon the earth, among the children of men, in the presence of all the hosts of heaven--

D&C 38:12 Which causeth silence to reign, and all eternity is pained, and the angels are waiting the great command to reap down the earth, to gather the tares that they may be burned; and, behold, the enemy is combined.

D&C 38:13 And now I show unto you a mystery, a thing which is had in secret chambers, to bring to pass even your destruction in process of time, and ye knew it not;

D&C 38:14 But now I tell it unto you, and ye are blessed, not because of your iniquity, neither your hearts of unbelief; for verily some of you are guilty before me, but I will be merciful unto your weakness.

D&C 38:15 Therefore, be ye strong from henceforth; fear not, for the kingdom is yours.

D&C 38:16 And for your salvation I give unto you a commandment, for I have heard your prayers, and the poor have complained before me, and the rich have I made, and all flesh is mine, and I am no respecter of persons.

D&C 38:17 And I have made the earth rich, and behold it is my footstool, wherefore, again I will stand upon it.

D&C 38:18 And I hold forth and deign to give unto you greater riches, even a land of promise, a land flowing with milk and honey, upon which there shall be no curse when the Lord cometh;

D&C 38:19 And I will give it unto you for the land of your inheritance, if you seek it with all your hearts.

D&C 38:20 And this shall be my covenant with you, ye shall have it for the land of your inheritance, and for the inheritance of your children forever, while the earth shall stand, and ye shall possess it again in eternity, no more to pass away.

D&C 38:21 But, verily I say unto you that in time ye shall have no king nor ruler, for I will be your king and watch over you.

D&C 38:22 Wherefore, hear my voice and follow me, and you shall be a free people, and ye shall have no laws but my laws when I come, for I am your lawgiver, and what can stay my hand?

D&C 38:23 But, verily I say unto you, teach one another according to the office wherewith I have appointed you;

D&C 38:24 And let every man esteem his brother as himself, and practise virtue and holiness before me.

D&C 38:25 And again I say unto you, let every man esteem his brother as himself.

D&C 38:26 For what man among you having twelve sons, and is no respecter of them, and they serve him obediently, and he saith unto the one: Be thou clothed in robes and sit thou here; and to the other: Be thou clothed in rags and sit thou there--and looketh upon his sons and saith I am just?

D&C 38:27 Behold, this I have given unto you as a parable, and it is even as I am. I say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.

D&C 38:28 And again, I say unto you that the enemy in the secret chambers seeketh your lives.

D&C 38:29 Ye hear of wars in far countries, and you say that there will soon be great wars in far countries, but ye know not the hearts of men in your own land.

D&C 38:30 I tell you these things because of your prayers; wherefore, treasure up wisdom in your bosoms, lest the wickedness of men reveal these things unto you by their wickedness, in a manner which shall speak in your ears with a voice louder than that which shall shake the earth; but if ye are prepared ye shall not fear.

D&C 38:31 And that ye might escape the power of the enemy, and be gathered unto me a righteous people, without spot and blameless--

D&C 38:32 Wherefore, for this cause I gave unto you the commandment that ye should go to the Ohio; and there I will give unto you my law; and there you shall be endowed with power from on high;

D&C 38:33 And from thence, whosoever I will shall go forth among all nations, and it shall be told them what they shall do; for I have a great work laid up in store, for Israel shall be saved, and I will lead them whithersoever I will, and no power shall stay my hand.

D&C 38:34 And now, I give unto the church in these parts a commandment, that certain men among them shall be appointed, and they shall be appointed by the voice of the church;

D&C 38:35 And they shall look to the poor and the needy, and administer to their relief that they shall not suffer; and send them forth to the place which I have commanded them;

D&C 38:36 And this shall be their work, to govern the affairs of the property of this church.

D&C 38:37 And they that have farms that cannot be sold, let them be left or rented as seemeth them good.

D&C 38:38 See that all things are preserved; and when men are endowed with power from on high and sent forth, all these things shall be gathered unto the bosom of the church.

D&C 38:39 And if ye seek the riches which it is the will of the Father to give unto you, ye shall be the richest of all people, for ye shall have the riches of eternity; and it must needs be that the riches of the earth are mine to give; but beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old.

D&C 38:40 And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a commandment, that every man, both elder, priest, teacher, and also member, go to with his might, with the labor of his hands, to prepare and accomplish the things which I have commanded.

D&C 38:41 And let your preaching be the warning voice, every man to his neighbor, in mildness and in meekness.

D&C 38:42 And go ye out from among the wicked. Save yourselves. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Even so. Amen.

D&C 39:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to James Covill, at Fayette, New York, January 5, 1831. James Covill covenanted that he would obey any command that the Lord would give to him through Joseph the Prophet. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 143. --The Lord Jesus Christ specifies the conditions under which men may become his sons--James Covill promised blessing beyond all he had ever known, conditioned on his obedience to the Lord's commandments.

D&C 39:1 Hearken and listen to the voice of him who is from all eternity to all eternity, the Great I AM, even Jesus Christ--

D&C 39:2 The light and the life of the world; a light which shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not;

D&C 39:3 The same which came in the meridian of time unto mine own, and mine own received me not;

D&C 39:4 But to as many as received me, gave I power to become my sons; and even so will I give unto as many as will receive me, power to become my sons.

D&C 39:5 And verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth my gospel receiveth me; and he that receiveth not my gospel receiveth not me.

D&C 39:6 And this is my gospel--repentance and baptism by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which showeth all things, and teacheth the peaceable things of the kingdom.

D&C 39:7 And now, behold, I say unto you, my servant James, I have looked upon thy works and I know thee.

D&C 39:8 And verily I say unto thee, thine heart is now right before me at this time; and, behold, I have bestowed great blessings upon thy head;

D&C 39:9 Nevertheless, thou hast seen great sorrow, for thou hast rejected me many times because of pride and the cares of the world.

D&C 39:10 But, behold, the days of thy deliverance are come, if thou wilt hearken to my voice, which saith unto thee: Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on my name, and you shall receive my Spirit, and a blessing so great as you never have known.

D&C 39:11 And if thou do this, I have prepared thee for a greater work. Thou shalt preach the fulness of my gospel, which I have sent forth in these last days, the covenant which I have sent forth to recover my people, which are of the house of Israel.

D&C 39:12 And it shall come to pass that power shall rest upon thee; thou shalt have great faith, and I will be with thee and go before thy face.

D&C 39:13 Thou art called to labor in my vineyard, and to build up my church, and to bring forth Zion, that it may rejoice upon the hills and flourish.

D&C 39:14 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou art not called to go into the eastern countries, but thou art called to go to the Ohio.

D&C 39:15 And inasmuch as my people shall assemble themselves at the Ohio, I have kept in store a blessing such as is not known among the children of men, and it shall be poured forth upon their heads. And from thence men shall go forth into all nations.

D&C 39:16 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that the people in Ohio call upon me in much faith, thinking I will stay my hand in judgment upon the nations, but I cannot deny my word.

D&C 39:17 Wherefore lay to with your might and call faithful laborers into my vineyard, that it may be pruned for the last time.

D&C 39:18 And inasmuch as they do repent and receive the fulness of my gospel, and become sanctified, I will stay mine hand in judgment.

D&C 39:19 Wherefore, go forth, crying with a loud voice, saying: The kingdom of heaven is at hand; crying: Hosanna! blessed be the name of the Most High God.

D&C 39:20 Go forth baptizing with water, preparing the way before my face for the time of my coming;

D&C 39:21 For the time is at hand; the day or the hour no man knoweth; but it surely shall come.

D&C 39:22 And he that receiveth these things receiveth me; and they shall be gathered unto me in time and in eternity.

D&C 39:23 And again, it shall come to pass that on as many as ye shall baptize with water, ye shall lay your hands, and they shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and shall be looking forth for the signs of my coming, and shall know me.

D&C 39:24 Behold, I come quickly. Even so. Amen.

D&C 40:0 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Fayette, New York, January, 1831. Preceding the record of this revelation, the Prophet wrote: As James Covill rejected the word of the Lord, and returned to his former principles and people, the Lord gave unto me and

D&C 40:1 Behold, verily I say unto you, that the heart of my servant James Covill was right before me, for he covenanted with me that he would obey my word.

D&C 40:2 And he received the word with gladness, but straightway Satan tempted him; and the fear of persecution and the cares of the world caused him to reject the word.

D&C 40:3 Wherefore he broke my covenant, and it remaineth with me to do with him as seemeth me good. Amen.

D&C 41:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to the Church, at Kirtland, Ohio, February 4, 1831. The Kirtland brand of the Church at this time was rapidly increasing in numbers, and the Saints generally were striving to live according to the commandments of the Lord; but, the Prophet states, some strange notions and false spirits had crept in among them. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 146. --Commandment regarding the observance of the law of the Lord--Promise of greater knowledge as to the government of the Church--Edward Partridge named as the first Bishop unto the Church.

D&C 41:1 Hearken and hear, O ye my people, saith the Lord and your God, ye whom I delight to bless with the greatest of all blessings, ye that hear me; and ye that hear me not will I curse, that have professed my name, with the heaviest of all cursings.

D&C 41:2 Hearken, O ye elders of my church whom I have called, behold I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall assemble yourselves together to agree upon my word;

D&C 41:3 And by the prayer of your faith ye shall receive my law, that ye may know how to govern my church and have all things right before me.

D&C 41:4 And I will be your ruler when I come; and behold, I come quickly, and ye shall see that my law is kept.

D&C 41:5 He that receiveth my law and doeth it, the same is my disciple; and he that saith he receiveth it and doeth it not, the same is not my disciple, and shall be cast out from among you;

D&C 41:6 For it is not meet that the things which belong to the children of the kingdom should be given to them that are not worthy, or to dogs, or the pearls to be cast before swine.

D&C 41:7 And again, it is meet that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., should have a house built, in which to live and translate.

D&C 41:8 And again, it is meet that my servant Sidney Rigdon should live as seemeth him good, inasmuch as he keepeth my commandments.

D&C 41:9 And again, I have called my servant Edward Partridge; and I give a commandment, that he should be appointed by the voice of the church, and ordained a bishop unto the church, to leave his merchandise and to spend all his time in the labors of the church;

D&C 41:10 To see to all things as it shall be appointed unto him in my laws in the day that I shall give them.

D&C 41:11 And this because his heart is pure before me, for he is like unto Nathanael of old, in whom there is no guile.

D&C 41:12 These words are given unto you, and they are pure before me; wherefore, beware how you hold them, for they are to be answered upon your souls in the day of judgment. Even so. Amen.

D&C 42:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, February 9, 1831, in the presence of twelve Elders, and in fulfilment of the Lord's promise previously made; see Section 38:32. The Prophet specifies this revelation as embracing the law of the Church. --Elders commanded to go forth two by two westward, preaching and baptizing, according to the Bible and the Book of Mormon, and according to the latter-day revelations already given and to be given--Several commandments comprised in the decalog reiterated--Church members who commit crimes to be handed over to the law of the land--Members required to impart of their substance for the needs of the poor and the building up of the Church--Site of the New Jerusalem to be revealed later--Pride of heart and costly apparel forbidden--The idler denounced--Administration to the afflicted by the laying on of hands of the Elders--Comforting assurance concerning those who die in the Lord--Sexual sin proclaimed against--The fundamental principles of Church discipline.

D&C 42:1 Hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have assembled yourselves together in my name, even Jesus Christ the Son of the living God, the Savior of the world; inasmuch as ye believe on my name and keep my commandments.

D&C 42:2 Again I say unto you, hearken and hear and obey the law which I shall give unto you.

D&C 42:3 For verily I say, as ye have assembled yourselves together according to the commandment wherewith I commanded you, and are agreed as touching this one thing, and have asked the Father in my name, even so ye shall receive.

D&C 42:4 Behold, verily I say unto you, I give unto you this first commandment, that ye shall go forth in my name, every one of you, excepting my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon.

D&C 42:5 And I give unto them a commandment that they shall go forth for a little season, and it shall be given by the power of the Spirit when they shall return.

D&C 42:6 And ye shall go forth in the power of my Spirit, preaching my gospel, two by two, in my name, lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump, declaring my word like unto angels of God.

D&C 42:7 And ye shall go forth baptizing with water, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

D&C 42:8 And from this place ye shall go forth into the regions westward; and inasmuch as ye shall find them that will receive you ye shall build up my church in every region--

D&C 42:9 Until the time shall come when it shall be revealed unto you from on high, when the city of the New Jerusalem shall be prepared, that ye may be gathered in one, that ye may be my people and I will be your God.

D&C 42:10 And again, I say unto you, that my servant Edward Partridge shall stand in the office whereunto I have appointed him. And it shall come to pass, that if he transgress another shall be appointed in his stead. Even so. Amen.

D&C 42:11 Again I say unto you, that it shall not be given to any one to go forth to preach my gospel, or to build up my church, except he be ordained by some one who has authority, and it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church.

D&C 42:12 And again, the elders, priests and teachers of this church shall teach the principles of my gospel, which are in the Bible and the Book of Mormon, in the which is the fulness of the gospel.

D&C 42:13 And they shall observe the covenants and church articles to do them, and these shall be their teachings, as they shall be directed by the Spirit.

D&C 42:14 And the Spirit shall be given unto you by the prayer of faith; and if ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach.

D&C 42:15 And all this ye shall observe to do as I have commanded concerning your teaching, until the fulness of my scriptures is given.

D&C 42:16 And as ye shall lift up your voices by the Comforter, ye shall speak and prophesy as seemeth me good;

D&C 42:17 For, behold, the Comforter knoweth all things, and beareth record of the Father and of the Son.

D&C 42:18 And now, behold, I speak unto the church. Thou shalt not kill; and he that kills shall not have forgiveness in this world, nor in the world to come.

D&C 42:19 And again, I say, thou shalt not kill; but he that killeth shall die.

D&C 42:20 Thou shalt not steal; and he that stealeth and will not repent shall be cast out.

D&C 42:21 Thou shalt not lie; he that lieth and will not repent shall be cast out.

D&C 42:22 Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.

D&C 42:23 And he that looketh upon a woman to lust after her shall deny the faith, and shall not have the Spirit; and if he repents not he shall be cast out.

D&C 42:24 Thou shalt not commit adultery; and he that committeth adultery, and repenteth not, shall be cast out.

D&C 42:25 But he that has committed adultery and repents with all his heart, and forsaketh it, and doeth it no more, thou shalt forgive;

D&C 42:26 But if he doeth it again, he shall not be forgiven, but shall be cast out.

D&C 42:27 Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbor, nor do him any harm.

D&C 42:28 Thou knowest my laws concerning these things are given in my scriptures; he that sinneth and repenteth not shall be cast out.

D&C 42:29 If thou lovest me thou shalt serve me and keep all my commandments.

D&C 42:30 And behold, thou wilt remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties for their support that which thou hast to impart unto them, with a covenant and a deed which cannot be broken.

D&C 42:31 And inasmuch as ye impart of your substance unto the poor, ye will do it unto me; and they shall be laid before the bishop of my church and his counselors, two of the elders, or high priests, such as he shall appoint or has appointed and set apart for that purpose.

D&C 42:32 And it shall come to pass, that after they are laid before the bishop of my church, and after that he has received these testimonies concerning the consecration of the properties of my church, that they cannot be taken from the church, agreeable to my commandments, every man shall be made accountable unto me, a steward over his own property, or that which he has received by consecration, as much as is sufficient for himself and family.

D&C 42:33 And again, if there shall be properties in the hands of the church, or any individuals of it, more than is necessary for their support after this first consecration, which is a residue to be consecrated unto the bishop, it shall be kept to administer to those who have not, from time to time, that every man who has need may be amply supplied and receive according to his wants.

D&C 42:34 Therefore, the residue shall be kept in my storehouse, to administer to the poor and the needy, as shall be appointed by the high council of the church, and the bishop and his council;

D&C 42:35 And for the purpose of purchasing lands for the public benefit of the church, and building houses of worship, and building up of the New Jerusalem which is hereafter to be revealed--

D&C 42:36 That my covenant people may be gathered in one in that day when I shall come to my temple. And this I do for the salvation of my people.

D&C 42:37 And it shall come to pass, that he that sinneth and repenteth not shall be cast out of the church, and shall not receive again that which he has consecrated unto the poor and the needy of my church, or in other words, unto me--

D&C 42:38 For inasmuch as ye do it unto the least of these, ye do it unto me.

D&C 42:39 For it shall come to pass, that which I spake by the mouths of my prophets shall be fulfilled; for I will consecrate of the riches of those who embrace my gospel among the Gentiles unto the poor of my people who are of the house of Israel.

D&C 42:40 And again, thou shalt not be proud in thy heart; let all thy garments be plain, and their beauty the beauty of the work of thine own hands;

D&C 42:41 And let all things be done in cleanliness before me.

D&C 42:42 Thou shalt not be idle; for he that is idle shall not eat the bread nor wear the garments of the laborer.

D&C 42:43 And whosoever among you are sick, and have not faith to be healed, but believe, shall be nourished with all tenderness, with herbs and mild food, and that not by the hand of an enemy.

D&C 42:44 And the elders of the church, two or more, shall be called, and shall pray for and lay their hands upon them in my name; and if they die they shall die unto me, and if they live they shall live unto me.

D&C 42:45 Thou shalt live together in love, insomuch that thou shalt weep for the loss of them that die, and more especially for those that have not hope of a glorious resurrection.

D&C 42:46 And it shall come to pass that those that die in me shall not taste of death, for it shall be sweet unto them;

D&C 42:47 And they that die not in me, wo unto them, for their death is bitter.

D&C 42:48 And again, it shall come to pass that he that hath faith in me to be healed, and is not appointed unto death, shall be healed.

D&C 42:49 He who hath faith to see shall see.

D&C 42:50 He who hath faith to hear shall hear.

D&C 42:51 The lame who hath faith to leap shall leap.

D&C 42:52 And they who have not faith to do these things, but believe in me, have power to become my sons; and inasmuch as they break not my laws thou shalt bear their infirmities.

D&C 42:53 Thou shalt stand in the place of thy stewardship.

D&C 42:54 Thou shalt not take thy brother's garment; thou shalt pay for that which thou shalt receive of thy brother.

D&C 42:55 And if thou obtainest more than that which would be for thy support, thou shalt give it into my storehouse, that all things may be done according to that which I have said.

D&C 42:56 Thou shalt ask, and my scriptures shall be given as I have appointed, and they shall be preserved in safety;

D&C 42:57 And it is expedient that thou shouldst hold thy peace concerning them, and not teach them until ye have received them in full.

D&C 42:58 And I give unto you a commandment that then ye shall teach them unto all men; for they shall be taught unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and people.

D&C 42:59 Thou shalt take the things which thou hast received, which have been given unto thee in my scriptures for a law, to be my law to govern my church;

D&C 42:60 And he that doeth according to these things shall be saved, and he that doeth them not shall be damned if he so continue.

D&C 42:61 If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things--that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal.

D&C 42:62 Thou shalt ask, and it shall be revealed unto you in mine own due time where the New Jerusalem shall be built.

D&C 42:63 And behold, it shall come to pass that my servants shall be sent forth to the east and to the west, to the north and to the south.

D&C 42:64 And even now, let him that goeth to the east teach them that shall be converted to flee to the west, and this in consequence of that which is coming on the earth, and of secret combinations.

D&C 42:65 Behold, thou shalt observe all these things, and great shall be thy reward; for unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom, but unto the world it is not given to know them.

D&C 42:66 Ye shall observe the laws which ye have received and be faithful.

D&C 42:67 And ye shall hereafter receive church covenants, such as shall be sufficient to establish you, both here and in the New Jerusalem.

D&C 42:68 Therefore, he that lacketh wisdom, let him ask of me, and I will give him liberally and upbraid him not.

D&C 42:69 Lift up your hearts and rejoice, for unto you the kingdom, or in other words, the keys of the church have been given. Even so. Amen.

D&C 42:70 The priests and teachers shall have their stewardships, even as the members.

D&C 42:71 And the elders or high priests who are appointed to assist the bishop as counselors in all things, are to have their families supported out of the property which is consecrated to the bishop, for the good of the poor, and for other purposes, as before mentioned;

D&C 42:72 Or they are to receive a just remuneration for all their services, either a stewardship or otherwise, as may be thought best or decided by the counselors and bishop.

D&C 42:73 And the bishop, also, shall receive his support, or a just remuneration for all his services in the church.

D&C 42:74 Behold, verily I say unto you, that whatever persons among you, having put away their companions for the cause of fornication, or in other words, if they shall testify before you in all lowliness of heart that this is the case, ye shall not cast them out from among you;

D&C 42:75 But if ye shall find that any persons have left their companions for the sake of adultery, and they themselves are the offenders, and their companions are living, they shall be cast out from among you.

D&C 42:76 And again, I say unto you, that ye shall be watchful and careful, with all inquiry, that ye receive none such among you if they are married;

D&C 42:77 And if they are not married, they shall repent of all their sins or ye shall not receive them.

D&C 42:78 And again, every person who belongeth to this church of Christ, shall observe to keep all the commandments and covenants of the church.

D&C 42:79 And it shall come to pass, that if any persons among you shall kill they shall be delivered up and dealt with according to the laws of the land; for remember that he hath no forgiveness; and it shall be proved according to the laws of the land.

D&C 42:80 And if any man or woman shall commit adultery, he or she shall be tried before two elders of the church, or more, and every word shall be established against him or her by two witnesses of the church, and not of the enemy; but if there are more than two witnesses it is better.

D&C 42:81 But he or she shall be condemned by the mouth of two witnesses; and the elders shall lay the case before the church, and the church shall lift up their hands against him or her, that they may be dealt with according to the law of God.

D&C 42:82 And if it can be, it is necessary that the bishop be present also.

D&C 42:83 And thus ye shall do in all cases which shall come before you.

D&C 42:84 And if a man or woman shall rob, he or she shall be delivered up unto the law of the land.

D&C 42:85 And if he or she shall steal, he or she shall be delivered up unto the law of the land.

D&C 42:86 And if he or she shall lie, he or she shall be delivered up unto the law of the land.

D&C 42:87 And if he or she do any manner of iniquity, he or she shall be delivered up unto the law, even that of God.

D&C 42:88 And if thy brother or sister offend thee, thou shalt take him or her between him or her and thee alone; and if he or she confess thou shalt be reconciled.

D&C 42:89 And if he or she confess not thou shalt deliver him or her up unto the church, not to the members, but to the elders. And it shall be done in a meeting, and that not before the world.

D&C 42:90 And if thy brother or sister offend many, he or she shall be chastened before many.

D&C 42:91 And if any one offend openly, he or she shall be rebuked openly, that he or she may be ashamed. And if he or she confess not, he or she shall be delivered up unto the law of God.

D&C 42:92 If any shall offend in secret, he or she shall be rebuked in secret, that he or she may have opportunity to confess in secret to him or her whom he or she has offended, and to God, that the church may not speak reproachfully of him or her.

D&C 42:93 And thus shall ye conduct in all things.

D&C 43:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, in February, 1831. At this time some members of the Church were disturbed by people making false claims as revelators. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 154. --First part of the revelation addressed to the Elders of the Church--Revelations to the Church given only through the one appointed to receive such--Elders warned against spurious claims and false teachings of others--Elders sent forth to teach according to the spirit of revelation and not to be taught in the precepts of men--Assurances of the Lord's future advent--Calamities to precede his coming--Latter part of the revelation addressed to the nation of the earth--Warning, proclamation, and commandment.

D&C 43:1 O hearken, ye elders of my church, and give ear to the words which I shall speak unto you.

D&C 43:2 For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have received a commandment for a law unto my church, through him whom I have appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations from my hand.

D&C 43:3 And this ye shall know assuredly--that there is none other appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations until he be taken, if he abide in me.

D&C 43:4 But verily, verily, I say unto you, that none else shall be appointed unto this gift except it be through him; for if it be taken from him he shall not have power except to appoint another in his stead.

D&C 43:5 And this shall be a law unto you, that ye receive not the teachings of any that shall come before you as revelations or commandments;

D&C 43:6 And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived, that you may know they are not of me.

D&C 43:7 For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me shall come in at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before, to teach those revelations which you have received and shall receive through him whom I have appointed.

D&C 43:8 And now, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to act and direct my church, how to act upon the points of my law and commandments, which I have given.

D&C 43:9 And thus ye shall become instructed in the law of my church, and be sanctified by that which ye have received, and ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me--

D&C 43:10 That inasmuch as ye do this, glory shall be added to the kingdom which ye have received. Inasmuch as ye do it not, it shall be taken, even that which ye have received.

D&C 43:11 Purge ye out the iniquity which is among you; sanctify yourselves before me;

D&C 43:12 And if ye desire the glories of the kingdom, appoint ye my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and uphold him before me by the prayer of faith.

D&C 43:13 And again, I say unto you, that if ye desire the mysteries of the kingdom, provide for him food and raiment, and whatsoever thing he needeth to accomplish the work wherewith I have commanded him;

D&C 43:14 And if ye do it not he shall remain unto them that have received him, that I may reserve unto myself a pure people before me.

D&C 43:15 Again I say, hearken ye elders of my church, whom I have appointed: Ye are not sent forth to be taught, but to teach the children of men the things which I have put into your hands by the power of my Spirit;

D&C 43:16 And ye are to be taught from on high. Sanctify yourselves and ye shall be endowed with power, that ye may give even as I have spoken.

D&C 43:17 Hearken ye, for, behold, the great day of the Lord is nigh at hand.

D&C 43:18 For the day cometh that the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven; the heavens shall shake and the earth shall tremble, and the trump of God shall sound both long and loud, and shall say to the sleeping nations: Ye saints arise and live; ye sinners stay and sleep until I shall call again.

D&C 43:19 Wherefore gird up your loins lest ye be found among the wicked.

D&C 43:20 Lift up your voices and spare not. Call upon the nations to repent, both old and young, both bond and free, saying: Prepare yourselves for the great day of the Lord;

D&C 43:21 For if I, who am a man, do lift up my voice and call upon you to repent, and ye hate me, what will ye say when the day cometh when the thunders shall utter their voices from the ends of the earth, speaking to the ears of all that live, saying--Repent, and prepare for the great day of the Lord?

D&C 43:22 Yea, and again, when the lightnings shall streak forth from the east unto the west, and shall utter forth their voices unto all that live, and make the ears of all tingle that hear, saying these words--Repent ye, for the great day of the Lord is come?

D&C 43:23 And again, the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven, saying: Hearken, O ye nations of the earth, and hear the words of that God who made you.

D&C 43:24 O, ye nations of the earth, how often would I have gathered you together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not!

D&C 43:25 How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants, and by the ministering of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice of thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of tempests, and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice of famines and pestilences of every kind, and by the great sound of a trump, and by the voice of judgment, and by the voice of mercy all the day long, and by the voice of glory and honor and the riches of eternal life, and would have saved you with an everlasting salvation, but ye would not!

D&C 43:26 Behold, the day has come, when the cup of the wrath of mine indignation is full.

D&C 43:27 Behold, verily I say unto you, that these are the words of the Lord your God.

D&C 43:28 Wherefore, labor ye, labor ye in my vineyard for the last time--for the last time call upon the inhabitants of the earth.

D&C 43:29 For in mine own due time will I come upon the earth in judgment, and my people shall be redeemed and shall reign with me on earth.

D&C 43:30 For the great Millennium, of which I have spoken by the mouth of my servants, shall come.

D&C 43:31 For Satan shall be bound, and when he is loosed again he shall only reign for a little season, and then cometh the end of the earth.

D&C 43:32 And he that liveth in righteousness shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and the earth shall pass away so as by fire.

D&C 43:33 And the wicked shall go away into unquenchable fire, and their end no man knoweth on earth, nor ever shall know, until they come before me in judgment.

D&C 43:34 Hearken ye to these words. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. Treasure these things up in your hearts, and let the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds.

D&C 43:35 Be sober. Keep all my commandments. Even so. Amen.

D&C 44:0 Revelation given to Jospeh Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Kirtland, Ohio, in the latter part of February, 1831. In compliance with the requirement herein set forth the Church appointed a conference to be held early in the month of June following. --The Elders to assemble to receive further instruction--To organize according to the laws of the land, thus strengthening themselves against the machinations of the opponents.

D&C 44:1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto you my servants, it is expedient in me that the elders of my church should be called together, from the east and from the west, and from the north and from the south, by letter or some other way.

D&C 44:2 And it shall come to pass, that inasmuch as they are faithful, and exercise faith in me, I will pour out my Spirit upon them in the day that they assemble themselves together.

D&C 44:3 And it shall come to pass that they shall go forth into the regions round about, and preach repentance unto the people.

D&C 44:4 And many shall be converted, insomuch that ye shall obtain power to organize yourselves according to the laws of man;

D&C 44:5 That your enemies may not have power over you; that you may be preserved in all things; that you may be enabled to keep my laws; that every bond may be broken wherewith the enemy seeketh to destroy my people.

D&C 44:6 Behold, I say unto you, that ye must visit the poor and the needy and administer to their relief, that they may be kept until all things may be done according to my law which ye have received. Amen.

D&C 45:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to the Church, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 7, 1831. Prefacing his record of this revelation, the Prophet states that at this age of the Church many false reports and foolish stories were published and circulated, to prevent people from investigating the work or embracing the faith. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 158. --Jesus Christ the advocate for His people with the Father--Blessed state of Enoch and his people--Prediction made to the disciples in former days cited--Times of the Gentiles signalized by the light of the Gospel--In the same generation the times of the Gentiles to be fulfilled--A desolating sickness named among the many tribulations preceding the coming of the Lord in judgment--Significance of the parable of the fig-trees and that of the ten virgins--Gathering of the people from the eastern lands into the western countries--Promise of the establishment of the New Jerusalem--Eventual triumph of Zion.

D&C 45:1 Hearken, O ye people of my church, to whom the kingdom has been given; hearken ye and give ear to him who laid the foundation of the earth, who made the heavens and all the hosts thereof, and by whom all things were made which live, and move, and have a being.

D&C 45:2 And again I say, hearken unto my voice, lest death shall overtake you; in an hour when ye think not the summer shall be past, and the harvest ended, and your souls not saved.

D&C 45:3 Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him--

D&C 45:4 Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified;

D&C 45:5 Wherefore, Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may come unto me and have everlasting life.

D&C 45:6 Hearken, O ye people of my church, and ye elders listen together, and hear my voice while it is called today, and harden not your hearts;

D&C 45:7 For verily I say unto you that I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the light and the life of the world--a light that shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not.

D&C 45:8 I came unto mine own, and mine own received me not; but unto as many as received me gave I power to do many miracles, and to become the sons of God; and even unto them that believed on my name gave I power to obtain eternal life.

D&C 45:9 And even so I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world, to be a light to the world, and to be a standard for my people, and for the Gentiles to seek to it, and to be a messenger before my face to prepare the way before me.

D&C 45:10 Wherefore, come ye unto it, and with him that cometh I will reason as with men in days of old, and I will show unto you my strong reasoning.

D&C 45:11 Wherefore, hearken ye together and let me show unto you even my wisdom--the wisdom of him whom ye say is the God of Enoch, and his brethren,

D&C 45:12 Who were separated from the earth, and were received unto myself--a city reserved until a day of righteousness shall come--a day which was sought for by all holy men, and they found it not because of wickedness and abominations;

D&C 45:13 And confessed they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth;

D&C 45:14 But obtained a promise that they should find it and see it in their flesh.

D&C 45:15 Wherefore, hearken and I will reason with you, and I will speak unto you and prophesy, as unto men in days of old.

D&C 45:16 And I will show it plainly as I showed it unto my disciples as I stood before them in the flesh, and spake unto them, saying: As ye have asked of me concerning the signs of my coming, in the day when I shall come in my glory in the clouds of heaven, to fulfil the promises that I have made unto your fathers,

D&C 45:17 For as ye have looked upon the long absence of your spirits from your bodies to be a bondage, I will show unto you how the day of redemption shall come, and also the restoration of the scattered Israel.

D&C 45:18 And now ye behold this temple which is in Jerusalem, which ye call the house of God, and your enemies say that this house shall never fall.

D&C 45:19 But, verily I say unto you, that desolation shall come upon this generation as a thief in the night, and this people shall be destroyed and scattered among all nations.

D&C 45:20 And this temple which ye now see shall be thrown down that there shall not be left one stone upon another.

D&C 45:21 And it shall come to pass, that this generation of Jews shall not pass away until every desolation which I have told you concerning them shall come to pass.

D&C 45:22 Ye say that ye know that the end of the world cometh; ye say also that ye know that the heavens and the earth shall pass away;

D&C 45:23 And in this ye say truly, for so it is; but these things which I have told you shall not pass away until all shall be fulfilled.

D&C 45:24 And this I have told you concerning Jerusalem; and when that day shall come, shall a remnant be scattered among all nations;

D&C 45:25 But they shall be gathered again; but they shall remain until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

D&C 45:26 And in that day shall be heard of wars and rumors of wars, and the whole earth shall be in commotion, and men's hearts shall fail them, and they shall say that Christ delayeth his coming until the end of the earth.

D&C 45:27 And the love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound.

D&C 45:28 And when the times of the Gentiles is come in, a light shall break forth among them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my gospel;

D&C 45:29 But they receive it not; for they perceive not the light, and they turn their hearts from me because of the precepts of men.

D&C 45:30 And in that generation shall the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

D&C 45:31 And there shall be men standing in that generation, that shall not pass until they shall see an overflowing scourge; for a desolating sickness shall cover the land.

D&C 45:32 But my disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved; but among the wicked, men shall lift up their voices and curse God and die.

D&C 45:33 And there shall be earthquakes also in divers places, and many desolations; yet men will harden their hearts against me, and they will take up the sword, one against another, and they will kill one another.

D&C 45:34 And now, when I the Lord had spoken these words unto my disciples, they were troubled.

D&C 45:35 And I said unto them: Be not troubled, for, when all these things shall come to pass, ye may know that the promises which have been made unto you shall be fulfilled.

D&C 45:36 And when the light shall begin to break forth, it shall be with them like unto a parable which I will show you--

D&C 45:37 Ye look and behold the figtrees, and ye see them with your eyes, and ye say when they begin to shoot forth, and their leaves are yet tender, that summer is now nigh at hand;

D&C 45:38 Even so it shall be in that day when they shall see all these things, then shall they know that the hour is nigh.

D&C 45:39 And it shall come to pass that he that feareth me shall be looking forth for the great day of the Lord to come, even for the signs of the coming of the Son of Man.

D&C 45:40 And they shall see signs and wonders, for they shall be shown forth in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath.

D&C 45:41 And they shall behold blood, and fire, and vapors of smoke.

D&C 45:42 And before the day of the Lord shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into blood, and the stars fall from heaven.

D&C 45:43 And the remnant shall be gathered unto this place;

D&C 45:44 And then they shall look for me, and, behold, I will come; and they shall see me in the clouds of heaven, clothed with power and great glory; with all the holy angels; and he that watches not for me shall be cut off.

D&C 45:45 But before the arm of the Lord shall fall, an angel shall sound his trump, and the saints that have slept shall come forth to meet me in the cloud.

D&C 45:46 Wherefore, if ye have slept in peace blessed are you; for as you now behold me and know that I am, even so shall ye come unto me and your souls shall live, and your redemption shall be perfected; and the saints shall come forth from the four quarters of the earth.

D&C 45:47 Then shall the arm of the Lord fall upon the nations.

D&C 45:48 And then shall the Lord set his foot upon this mount, and it shall cleave in twain, and the earth shall tremble, and reel to and fro, and the heavens also shall shake.

D&C 45:49 And the Lord shall utter his voice, and all the ends of the earth shall hear it; and the nations of the earth shall mourn, and they that have laughed shall see their folly.

D&C 45:50 And calamity shall cover the mocker, and the scorner shall be consumed; and they that have watched for iniquity shall be hewn down and cast into the fire.

D&C 45:51 And then shall the Jews look upon me and say: What are these wounds in thine hands and in thy feet?

D&C 45:52 Then shall they know that I am the Lord; for I will say unto them: These wounds are the wounds with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. I am he who was lifted up. I am Jesus that was crucified. I am the Son of God.

D&C 45:53 And then shall they weep because of their iniquities; then shall they lament because they persecuted their king.

D&C 45:54 And then shall the heathen nations be redeemed, and they that knew no law shall have part in the first resurrection; and it shall be tolerable for them.

D&C 45:55 And Satan shall be bound, that he shall have no place in the hearts of the children of men.

D&C 45:56 And at that day, when I shall come in my glory, shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake concerning the ten virgins.

D&C 45:57 For they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived--verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day.

D&C 45:58 And the earth shall be given unto them for an inheritance; and they shall multiply and wax strong, and their children shall grow up without sin unto salvation.

D&C 45:59 For the Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will be their king and their lawgiver.

D&C 45:60 And now, behold, I say unto you, it shall not be given unto you to know any further concerning this chapter, until the New Testament be translated, and in it all these things shall be made known;

D&C 45:61 Wherefore I give unto you that ye may now translate it, that ye may be prepared for the things to come.

D&C 45:62 For verily I say unto you, that great things await you;

D&C 45:63 Ye hear of wars in foreign lands; but, behold, I say unto you, they are nigh, even at your doors, and not many years hence ye shall hear of wars in your own lands.

D&C 45:64 Wherefore I, the Lord, have said, gather ye out from the eastern lands, assemble ye yourselves together ye elders of my church; go ye forth into the western countries, call upon the inhabitants to repent, and inasmuch as they do repent, build up churches unto me.

D&C 45:65 And with one heart and with one mind, gather up your riches that ye may purchase an inheritance which shall hereafter be appointed unto you.

D&C 45:66 And it shall be called the New Jerusalem, a land of peace, a city of refuge, a place of safety for the saints of the Most High God;

D&C 45:67 And the glory of the Lord shall be there, and the terror of the Lord also shall be there, insomuch that the wicked will not come unto it, and it shall be called Zion.

D&C 45:68 And it shall come to pass among the wicked, that every man that will not take his sword against his neighbor must needs flee unto Zion for safety.

D&C 45:69 And there shall be gathered unto it out of every nation under heaven; and it shall be the only people that shall not be at war one with another.

D&C 45:70 And it shall be said among the wicked: Let us not go up to battle against Zion, for the inhabitants of Zion are terrible; wherefore we cannot stand.

D&C 45:71 And it shall come to pass that the righteous shall be gathered out from among all nations, and shall come to Zion, singing with songs of everlasting joy.

D&C 45:72 And now I say unto you, keep these things from going abroad unto the world until it is expedient in me, that ye may accomplish this work in the eyes of the people, and in the eyes of your enemies, that they may not know your works until ye have accomplished the thing which I have commanded you;

D&C 45:73 That when they shall know it, that they may consider these things.

D&C 45:74 For when the Lord shall appear he shall be terrible unto them, that fear may seize upon them, and they shall stand afar off and tremble.

D&C 45:75 And all nations shall be afraid because of the terror of the Lord, and the power of his might. Even so. Amen.

D&C 46:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to the Church, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 8 1831. A custom of admitting to the sacrament meetings and other assemblies of the Church only members and earnest investigators had become somewhat general. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 163. --Meetings of the Church to be conducted as the Holy Spirit shall guide--Neither members nor earnest seekers after the truth to be excluded from sacramental services--Many of the gifts of the Holy Spirit enumerated--Power of discernment promised so that manifestations not inspired by the Spirit of God may be recognized.

D&C 46:1 Hearken, O ye people of my church; for verily I say unto you that these things were spoken unto you for your profit and learning.

D&C 46:2 But notwithstanding those things which are written, it always has been given to the elders of my church from the beginning, and ever shall be, to conduct all meetings as they are directed and guided by the Holy Spirit.

D&C 46:3 Nevertheless ye are commanded never to cast any one out from your public meetings, which are held before the world.

D&C 46:4 Ye are also commanded not to cast any one who belongeth to the church out of your sacrament meetings; nevertheless, if any have trespassed, let him not partake until he makes reconciliation.

D&C 46:5 And again I say unto you, ye shall not cast any out of your sacrament meetings who are earnestly seeking the kingdom--I speak this concerning those who are not of the church.

D&C 46:6 And again I say unto you, concerning your confirmation meetings, that if there be any that are not of the church, that are earnestly seeking after the kingdom, ye shall not cast them out.

D&C 46:7 But ye are commanded in all things to ask of God, who giveth liberally; and that which the Spirit testifies unto you even so I would that ye should do in all holiness of heart, walking uprightly before me, considering the end of your salvation, doing all things with prayer and thanksgiving, that ye may not be seduced by evil spirits, or doctrines of devils, or the commandments of men; for some are of men, and others of devils.

D&C 46:8 Wherefore, beware lest ye are deceived; and that ye may not be deceived seek ye earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given;

D&C 46:9 For verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do; that all may be benefited that seek or that ask of me, that ask and not for a sign that they may consume it upon their lusts.

D&C 46:10 And again, verily I say unto you, I would that ye should always remember, and always retain in your minds what those gifts are, that are given unto the church.

D&C 46:11 For all have not every gift given unto them; for there are many gifts, and to every man is given a gift by the Spirit of God.

D&C 46:12 To some is given one, and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.

D&C 46:13 To some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that he was crucified for the sins of the world.

D&C 46:14 To others it is given to believe on their words, that they also might have eternal life if they continue faithful.

D&C 46:15 And again, to some it is given by the Holy Ghost to know the differences of administration, as it will be pleasing unto the same Lord, according as the Lord will, suiting his mercies according to the conditions of the children of men.

D&C 46:16 And again, it is given by the Holy Ghost to some to know the diversities of operations, whether they be of God, that the manifestations of the Spirit may be given to every man to profit withal.

D&C 46:17 And again, verily I say unto you, to some is given, by the Spirit of God, the word of wisdom.

D&C 46:18 To another is given the word of knowledge, that all may be taught to be wise and to have knowledge.

D&C 46:19 And again, to some it is given to have faith to be healed;

D&C 46:20 And to others it is given to have faith to heal.

D&C 46:21 And again, to some is given the working of miracles;

D&C 46:22 And to others it is given to prophesy;

D&C 46:23 And to others the discerning of spirits.

D&C 46:24 And again, it is given to some to speak with tongues;

D&C 46:25 And to another is given the interpretation of tongues.

D&C 46:26 And all these gifts come from God, for the benefit of the children of God.

D&C 46:27 And unto the bishop of the church, and unto such as God shall appoint and ordain to watch over the church and to be elders unto the church, are to have it given unto them to discern all those gifts lest there shall be any among you professing and yet be not of God.

D&C 46:28 And it shall come to pass that he that asketh in Spirit shall receive in Spirit;

D&C 46:29 That unto some it may be given to have all those gifts, that there may be a head, in order that every member may be profited thereby.

D&C 46:30 He that asketh in the Spirit asketh according to the will of God; wherefore it is done even as he asketh.

D&C 46:31 And again, I say unto you, all things must be done in the name of Christ, whatsoever you do in the Spirit;

D&C 46:32 And ye must give thanks unto God in the Spirit for whatsoever blessing ye are blessed with.

D&C 46:33 And ye must practise virtue and holiness before me continually. Even so. Amen.

D&C 47:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, in Kirtland, Ohio, March 8, 1831. Prior to this time Oliver Cowdery had acted as Church historian and recorder. John Whitmer had not sought an appointment as historian, but, being desired to serve in this capacity had said that he would obey the will of the Lord in the matter. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 166. --John Whitmer designated as the keeper of the history of the Church.

D&C 47:1 Behold, it is expedient in me that my servant John should write and keep a regular history, and assist you, my servant Joseph, in transcribing all things which shall be given you, until he is called to further duties.

D&C 47:2 Again, verily I say unto you that he can also lift up his voice in meetings, whenever it shall be expedient.

D&C 47:3 And again, I say unto you that it shall be appointed unto him to keep the church record and history continually; for Oliver Cowdery I have appointed to another office.

D&C 47:4 Wherefore, it shall be given him, inasmuch as he is faithful, by the Comforter, to write these things. Even so. Amen.

D&C 48:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, March, 1831. Joseph had inquired of the Lord as to the mode of procedure in procuring lands for the settlement of the Saints, this being an important matter in view of the migration of members of the Church from New York State, in obedience to the Lord's command that they should assemble in Ohio. --The people already established in Ohio to share their holdings with new arrivals--Lands to be purchased as required--The people to follow the counsel of their presiding officers in the matter.

D&C 48:1 It is necessary that ye should remain for the present time in your places of abode, as it shall be suitable to your circumstances.

D&C 48:2 And inasmuch as ye have lands, ye shall impart to the eastern brethren;

D&C 48:3 And inasmuch as ye have not lands, let them buy for the present time in those regions round about, as seemeth them good, for it must needs be necessary that they have places to live for the present time.

D&C 48:4 It must needs be necessary that ye save all the money that ye can, and that ye obtain all that ye can in righteousness, that in time ye may be enabled to purchase land for an inheritance, even the city.

D&C 48:5 The place is not yet to be revealed; but after your brethren come from the east there are to be certain men appointed, and to them it shall be given to know the place, or to them it shall be revealed.

D&C 48:6 And they shall be appointed to purchase the lands, and to make a commencement to lay the foundation of the city; and then shall ye begin to be gathered with your families, every man according to his family, according to his circumstances, and as is appointed to him by the presidency and the bishop of the church, according to the laws and commandments which ye have received, and which ye shall hereafter receive. Even so. Amen.

D&C 49:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, to Sidney Rigdon, Parley P. Pratt and Leman Copley, at Kirtland, Ohio, March, 1831. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 167. Leman Copley had embraced the Gospel, but still held to some of the teachings of the Shakers, or Shaking Quakers, of whom he had formerly been one. Many of these people were honest-hearted, and the Lord directed his servants to labor amongst them. --Exact time of the Lord's advent not to be revealed prior to the great event--Sanctity of marriage as a low of God unto man--Complete abstinence from meat not required--Development of Lamanites and establishment of Zion to precede the coming of the great day of the Lord.

D&C 49:1 Hearken unto my word, my servants Sidney, and Parley, and Leman; for behold, verily I say unto you, that I give unto you a commandment that you shall go and preach my gospel which ye have received, even as ye have received it, unto the Shakers.

D&C 49:2 Behold, I say unto you, that they desire to know the truth in part, but not all, for they are not right before me and must needs repent.

D&C 49:3 Wherefore, I send you, my servants Sidney and Parley, to preach the gospel unto them.

D&C 49:4 And my servant Leman shall be ordained unto this work, that he may reason with them, not according to that which he has received of them, but according to that which shall be taught him by you my servants; and by so doing I will bless him, otherwise he shall not prosper.

D&C 49:5 Thus saith the Lord; for I am God, and have sent mine Only Begotten Son into the world for the redemption of the world, and have decreed that he that receiveth him shall be saved, and he that receiveth him not shall be damned--

D&C 49:6 And they have done unto the Son of Man even as they listed; and he has taken his power on the right hand of his glory, and now reigneth in the heavens, and will reign till he descends on the earth to put all enemies under his feet, which time is nigh at hand--

D&C 49:7 I, the Lord God, have spoken it; but the hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes.

D&C 49:8 Wherefore, I will that all men shall repent, for all are under sin, except those which I have reserved unto myself, holy men that ye know not of.

D&C 49:9 Wherefore, I say unto you that I have sent unto you mine everlasting covenant, even that which was from the beginning.

D&C 49:10 And that which I have promised I have so fulfilled, and the nations of the earth shall bow to it; and, if not of themselves, they shall come down, for that which is now exalted of itself shall be laid low of power.

D&C 49:11 Wherefore, I give unto you a commandment that ye go among this people, and say unto them, like unto mine apostle of old, whose name was Peter:

D&C 49:12 Believe on the name of the Lord Jesus, who was on the earth, and is to come, the beginning and the end;

D&C 49:13 Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, according to the holy commandment, for the remission of sins;

D&C 49:14 And whoso doeth this shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of the hands of the elders of the church.

D&C 49:15 And again, verily I say unto you, that whoso forbiddeth to marry is not ordained of God, for marriage is ordained of God unto man.

D&C 49:16 Wherefore, it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation;

D&C 49:17 And that it might be filled with the measure of man, according to his creation before the world was made.

D&C 49:18 And whoso forbiddeth to abstain from meats, that man should not eat the same, is not ordained of God;

D&C 49:19 For, behold, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and that which cometh of the earth, is ordained for the use of man for food and for raiment, and that he might have in abundance.

D&C 49:20 But it is not given that one man should possess that which is above another, wherefore the world lieth in sin.

D&C 49:21 And wo be unto man that sheddeth blood or that wasteth flesh and hath no need.

D&C 49:22 And again, verily I say unto you, that the Son of Man cometh not in the form of a woman, neither of a man traveling on the earth.

D&C 49:23 Wherefore, be not deceived, but continue in steadfastness, looking forth for the heavens to be shaken, and the earth to tremble and to reel to and fro as a drunken man, and for the valleys to be exalted, and for the mountains to be made low, and for the rough places to become smooth--and all this when the angel shall sound his trumpet.

D&C 49:24 But before the great day of the Lord shall come, Jacob shall flourish in the wilderness, and the Lamanites shall blossom as the rose.

D&C 49:25 Zion shall flourish upon the hills and rejoice upon the mountains, and shall be assembled together unto the place which I have appointed.

D&C 49:26 Behold, I say unto you, go forth as I have commanded you; repent of all your sins; ask and ye shall receive; knock and it shall be opened unto you.

D&C 49:27 Behold, I will go before you and be your rearward; and I will be in your midst, and you shall not be confounded.

D&C 49:28 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, and I come quickly. Even so. Amen.
