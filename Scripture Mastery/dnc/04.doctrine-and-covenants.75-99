D&C 75:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Amherst, Ohio, January 25, 1832. The occasion was that of a conference before appointed. Certain Elders, who had encountered difficulty in bringing men to an understanding of their message, desired to learn more in detail as to their immediate duties. This revelation followed. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 242. --Instructions for individual guidance of Elders who are to travel two by two--Necessity of constant prayer and unwavering faith--Directions for the care and support of the families of absent Elders.

D&C 75:1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I who speak even by the voice of my Spirit, even Alpha and Omega, your Lord and your God--

D&C 75:2 Hearken, O ye who have given your names to go forth to proclaim my gospel, and to prune my vineyard.

D&C 75:3 Behold, I say unto you that it is my will that you should go forth and not tarry, neither be idle but labor with your might--

D&C 75:4 Lifting up your voices as with the sound of a trump, proclaiming the truth according to the revelations and commandments which I have given you.

D&C 75:5 And thus, if ye are faithful ye shall be laden with many sheaves, and crowned with honor, and glory, and immortality, and eternal life.

D&C 75:6 Therefore, verily I say unto my servant William E. McLellin, I revoke the commission which I gave unto him to go unto the eastern countries;

D&C 75:7 And I give unto him a new commission and a new commandment, in the which I, the Lord, chasten him for the murmurings of his heart;

D&C 75:8 And he sinned; nevertheless, I forgive him and say unto him again, Go ye into the south countries.

D&C 75:9 And let my servant Luke Johnson go with him, and proclaim the things which I have commanded them--

D&C 75:10 Calling on the name of the Lord for the Comforter, which shall teach them all things that are expedient for them--

D&C 75:11 Praying always that they faint not; and inasmuch as they do this, I will be with them even unto the end.

D&C 75:12 Behold, this is the will of the Lord your God concerning you. Even so. Amen.

D&C 75:13 And again, verily thus saith the Lord, let my servant Orson Hyde and my servant Samuel H. Smith take their journey into the eastern countries, and proclaim the things which I have commanded them; and inasmuch as they are faithful, lo, I will be with them even unto the end.

D&C 75:14 And again, verily I say unto my servant Lyman Johnson, and unto my servant Orson Pratt, they shall also take their journey into the eastern countries; and behold, and lo, I am with them also, even unto the end.

D&C 75:15 And again, I say unto my servant Asa Dodds, and unto my servant Calves Wilson, that they also shall take their journey unto the western countries, and proclaim my gospel, even as I have commanded them.

D&C 75:16 And he who is faithful shall overcome all things, and shall be lifted up at the last day.

D&C 75:17 And again, I say unto my servant Major N. Ashley, and my servant Burr Riggs, let them take their journey also into the south country.

D&C 75:18 Yea, let all those take their journey, as I have commanded them, going from house to house, and from village to village, and from city to city.

D&C 75:19 And in whatsoever house ye enter, and they receive you, leave your blessing upon that house.

D&C 75:20 And in whatsoever house ye enter, and they receive you not, ye shall depart speedily from that house, and shake off the dust of your feet as a testimony against them.

D&C 75:21 And you shall be filled with joy and gladness; and know this, that in the day of judgment you shall be judges of that house, and condemn them;

D&C 75:22 And it shall be more tolerable for the heathen in the day of judgment, than for that house; therefore, gird up your loins and be faithful, and ye shall overcome all things, and be lifted up at the last day. Even so. Amen.

D&C 75:23 And again, thus saith the Lord unto you, O ye elders of my church, who have given your names that you might know his will concerning you--

D&C 75:24 Behold, I say unto you, that it is the duty of the church to assist in supporting the families of those, and also to support the families of those who are called and must needs be sent unto the world to proclaim the gospel unto the world.

D&C 75:25 Wherefore, I, the Lord, give unto you this commandment, that ye obtain places for your families, inasmuch as your brethren are willing to open their hearts.

D&C 75:26 And let all such as can obtain places for their families, and support of the church for them, not fail to go into the world, whether to the east or to the west, or to the north, or to the south.

D&C 75:27 Let them ask and they shall receive, knock and it shall be opened unto them, and be made known from on high, even by the Comforter, whither they shall go.

D&C 75:28 And again, verily I say unto you, that every man who is obliged to provide for his own family, let him provide, and he shall in nowise lose his crown; and let him labor in the church.

D&C 75:29 Let every man be diligent in all things. And the idler shall not have place in the church, except he repent and mend his ways.

D&C 75:30 Wherefore, let my servant Simeon Carter and my servant Emer Harris be united in the ministry;

D&C 75:31 And also my servant Ezra Thayre and my servant Thomas B. Marsh;

D&C 75:32 Also my servant Hyrum Smith and my servant Reynolds Cahoon;

D&C 75:33 And also my servant Daniel Stanton and my servant Seymour Brunson;

D&C 75:34 And also my servant Sylvester Smith and my servant Gideon Carter;

D&C 75:35 And also my servant Ruggles Eames and my servant Stephen Burnett;

D&C 75:36 And also my servant Micah B. Welton and also my servant Eden Smith. Even so. Amen.

D&C 76:0 A VISION, given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Sidney Rigdon, at Hiram, Ohio, February 16, 1832. Prefacing his record of this vision the Prophet wrote: "From sundry revelations which had been received, it was apparent that many important points touching the salvation of man had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled. It appeared self-evident from what truths were left, that if God rewarded every one according to the deeds done in the body, the term Heaven, as intended for the Saints' eternal home, must include more kingdoms than one." While he and Sidney Rigdon were engaged in studious and doubtless prayerful consideration of this matter, the glorious vision here recorded was given them. See History of the Church, vol.1, p. 245. --Revelation of truth, wisdom, and even mysteries promised unto those who are worthy--The eventual resurrection of both just and unjust--The two Elders bear solemn personal testimony that Jesus Christ lives--The expulsion of Lucifer, and his evil activities as Satan on the earth--Awful fate of those who become sons of perdition--Distinctive glories of the celestial, the terrestrial, and the telestial states--Qualifications of souls that shall be assigned to each--Glorious consummation of the Savior's work.

D&C 76:1 Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and rejoice ye inhabitants thereof, for the Lord is God, and beside him there is no Savior.

D&C 76:2 Great is his wisdom, marvelous are his ways, and the extent of his doings none can find out.

D&C 76:3 His purposes fail not, neither are there any who can stay his hand.

D&C 76:4 From eternity to eternity he is the same, and his years never fail.

D&C 76:5 For thus saith the Lord--I, the Lord, am merciful and gracious unto those who fear me, and delight to honor those who serve me in righteousness and in truth unto the end.

D&C 76:6 Great shall be their reward and eternal shall be their glory.

D&C 76:7 And to them will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come, will I make known unto them the good pleasure of my will concerning all things pertaining to my kingdom.

D&C 76:8 Yea, even the wonders of eternity shall they know, and things to come will I show them, even the things of many generations.

D&C 76:9 And their wisdom shall be great, and their understanding reach to heaven; and before them the wisdom of the wise shall perish, and the understanding of the prudent shall come to naught.

D&C 76:10 For by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my will--yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man.

D&C 76:11 We, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, being in the Spirit on the sixteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty-two--

D&C 76:12 By the power of the Spirit our eyes were opened and our understandings were enlightened, so as to see and understand the things of God--

D&C 76:13 Even those things which were from the beginning before the world was, which were ordained of the Father, through his Only Begotten Son, who was in the bosom of the Father, even from the beginning;

D&C 76:14 Of whom we bear record; and the record which we bear is the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, who is the Son, whom we saw and with whom we conversed in the heavenly vision.

D&C 76:15 For while we were doing the work of translation, which the Lord had appointed unto us, we came to the twenty-ninth verse of the fifth chapter of John, which was given unto us as follows--

D&C 76:16 Speaking of the resurrection of the dead, concerning those who shall hear the voice of the Son of Man:

D&C 76:17 And shall come forth; they who have done good, in the resurrection of the just; and they who have done evil, in the resurrection of the unjust.

D&C 76:18 Now this caused us to marvel, for it was given unto us of the Spirit.

D&C 76:19 And while we meditated upon these things, the Lord touched the eyes of our understandings and they were opened, and the glory of the Lord shone round about.

D&C 76:20 And we beheld the glory of the Son, on the right hand of the Father, and received of his fulness;

D&C 76:21 And saw the holy angels, and them who are sanctified before his throne, worshiping God, and the Lamb, who worship him forever and ever.

D&C 76:22 And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!

D&C 76:23 For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father--

D&C 76:24 That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.

D&C 76:25 And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God who was in authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the Only Begotten Son whom the Father loved and who was in the bosom of the Father, was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son,

D&C 76:26 And was called Perdition, for the heavens wept over him--he was Lucifer, a son of the morning.

D&C 76:27 And we beheld, and lo, he is fallen! is fallen, even a son of the morning!

D&C 76:28 And while we were yet in the Spirit, the Lord commanded us that we should write the vision; for we beheld Satan, that old serpent, even the devil, who rebelled against God, and sought to take the kingdom of our God and his Christ--

D&C 76:29 Wherefore, he maketh war with the saints of God, and encompasseth them round about.

D&C 76:30 And we saw a vision of the sufferings of those with whom he made war and overcame, for thus came the voice of the Lord unto us:

D&C 76:31 Thus saith the Lord concerning all those who know my power, and have been made partakers thereof, and suffered themselves through the power of the devil to be overcome, and to deny the truth and defy my power--

D&C 76:32 They are they who are the sons of perdition, of whom I say that it had been better for them never to have been born;

D&C 76:33 For they are vessels of wrath, doomed to suffer the wrath of God, with the devil and his angels in eternity;

D&C 76:34 Concerning whom I have said there is no forgiveness in this world nor in the world to come--

D&C 76:35 Having denied the Holy Spirit after having received it, and having denied the Only Begotten Son of the Father, having crucified him unto themselves and put him to an open shame.

D&C 76:36 These are they who shall go away into the lake of fire and brimstone, with the devil and his angels--

D&C 76:37 And the only ones on whom the second death shall have any power;

D&C 76:38 Yea, verily, the only ones who shall not be redeemed in the due time of the Lord, after the sufferings of his wrath.

D&C 76:39 For all the rest shall be brought forth by the resurrection of the dead, through the triumph and the glory of the Lamb, who was slain, who was in the bosom of the Father before the worlds were made.

D&C 76:40 And this is the gospel, the glad tidings, which the voice out of the heavens bore record unto us--

D&C 76:41 That he came into the world, even Jesus, to be crucified for the world, and to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness;

D&C 76:42 That through him all might be saved whom the Father had put into his power and made by him;

D&C 76:43 Who glorifies the Father, and saves all the works of his hands, except those sons of perdition who deny the Son after the Father has revealed him.

D&C 76:44 Wherefore, he saves all except them--they shall go away into everlasting punishment, which is endless punishment, which is eternal punishment, to reign with the devil and his angels in eternity, where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched, which is their torment--

D&C 76:45 And the end thereof, neither the place thereof, nor their torment, no man knows;

D&C 76:46 Neither was it revealed, neither is, neither will be revealed unto man, except to them who are made partakers thereof;

D&C 76:47 Nevertheless, I, the Lord, show it by vision unto many, but straightway shut it up again;

D&C 76:48 Wherefore, the end, the width, the height, the depth, and the misery thereof, they understand not, neither any man except those who are ordained unto this condemnation.

D&C 76:49 And we heard the voice, saying: Write the vision, for lo, this is the end of the vision of the sufferings of the ungodly.

D&C 76:50 And again we bear record--for we saw and heard, and this is the testimony of the gospel of Christ concerning them who shall come forth in the resurrection of the just--

D&C 76:51 They are they who received the testimony of Jesus, and believed on his name and were baptized after the manner of his burial, being buried in the water in his name, and this according to the commandment which he has given--

D&C 76:52 That by keeping the commandments they might be washed and cleansed from all their sins, and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of the hands of him who is ordained and sealed unto this power;

D&C 76:53 And who overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true.

D&C 76:54 They are they who are the church of the Firstborn.

D&C 76:55 They are they into whose hands the Father has given all things--

D&C 76:56 They are they who are priests and kings, who have received of his fulness, and of his glory;

D&C 76:57 And are priests of the Most High, after the order of Melchizedek, which was after the order of Enoch, which was after the order of the Only Begotten Son.

D&C 76:58 Wherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God--

D&C 76:59 Wherefore, all things are theirs, whether life or death, or things present, or things to come, all are theirs and they are Christ's, and Christ is God's.

D&C 76:60 And they shall overcome all things.

D&C 76:61 Wherefore, let no man glory in man, but rather let him glory in God, who shall subdue all enemies under his feet.

D&C 76:62 These shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ forever and ever.

D&C 76:63 These are they whom he shall bring with him, when he shall come in the clouds of heaven to reign on the earth over his people.

D&C 76:64 These are they who shall have part in the first resurrection.

D&C 76:65 These are they who shall come forth in the resurrection of the just.

D&C 76:66 These are they who are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly place, the holiest of all.

D&C 76:67 These are they who have come to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of Enoch, and of the Firstborn.

D&C 76:68 These are they whose names are written in heaven, where God and Christ are the judge of all.

D&C 76:69 These are they who are just men made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood.

D&C 76:70 These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all, whose glory the sun of the firmament is written of as being typical.

D&C 76:71 And again, we saw the terrestrial world, and behold and lo, these are they who are of the terrestrial, whose glory differs from that of the church of the Firstborn who have received the fulness of the Father, even as that of the moon differs from the sun in the firmament.

D&C 76:72 Behold, these are they who died without law;

D&C 76:73 And also they who are the spirits of men kept in prison, whom the Son visited, and preached the gospel unto them, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh;

D&C 76:74 Who received not the testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it.

D&C 76:75 These are they who are honorable men of the earth, who were blinded by the craftiness of men.

D&C 76:76 These are they who receive of his glory, but not of his fulness.

D&C 76:77 These are they who receive of the presence of the Son, but not of the fulness of the Father.

D&C 76:78 Wherefore, they are bodies terrestrial, and not bodies celestial, and differ in glory as the moon differs from the sun.

D&C 76:79 These are they who are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus; wherefore, they obtain not the crown over the kingdom of our God.

D&C 76:80 And now this is the end of the vision which we saw of the terrestrial, that the Lord commanded us to write while we were yet in the Spirit.

D&C 76:81 And again, we saw the glory of the telestial, which glory is that of the lesser, even as the glory of the stars differs from that of the glory of the moon in the firmament.

D&C 76:82 These are they who received not the gospel of Christ, neither the testimony of Jesus.

D&C 76:83 These are they who deny not the Holy Spirit.

D&C 76:84 These are they who are thrust down to hell.

D&C 76:85 These are they who shall not be redeemed from the devil until the last resurrection, until the Lord, even Christ the Lamb, shall have finished his work.

D&C 76:86 These are they who receive not of his fulness in the eternal world, but of the Holy Spirit through the ministration of the terrestrial;

D&C 76:87 And the terrestrial through the ministration of the celestial.

D&C 76:88 And also the telestial receive it of the administering of angels who are appointed to minister for them, or who are appointed to be ministering spirits for them; for they shall be heirs of salvation.

D&C 76:89 And thus we saw, in the heavenly vision, the glory of the telestial, which surpasses all understanding;

D&C 76:90 And no man knows it except him to whom God has revealed it.

D&C 76:91 And thus we saw the glory of the terrestrial which excels in all things the glory of the telestial, even in glory, and in power, and in might, and in dominion.

D&C 76:92 And thus we saw the glory of the celestial, which excels in all things--where God, even the Father, reigns upon his throne forever and ever;

D&C 76:93 Before whose throne all things bow in humble reverence, and give him glory forever and ever.

D&C 76:94 They who dwell in his presence are the church of the Firstborn; and they see as they are seen, and know as they are known, having received of his fulness and of his grace;

D&C 76:95 And he makes them equal in power, and in might, and in dominion.

D&C 76:96 And the glory of the celestial is one, even as the glory of the sun is one.

D&C 76:97 And the glory of the terrestrial is one, even as the glory of the moon is one.

D&C 76:98 And the glory of the telestial is one, even as the glory of the stars is one; for as one star differs from another star in glory, even so differs one from another in glory in the telestial world;

D&C 76:99 For these are they who are of Paul, and of Apollos, and of Cephas.

D&C 76:100 These are they who say they are some of one and some of another--some of Christ and some of John, and some of Moses, and some of Elias, and some of Esaias, and some of Isaiah, and some of Enoch;

D&C 76:101 But received not the gospel, neither the testimony of Jesus, neither the prophets, neither the everlasting covenant.

D&C 76:102 Last of all, these all are they who will not be gathered with the saints, to be caught up unto the church of the Firstborn, and received into the cloud.

D&C 76:103 These are they who are liars, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and whoremongers, and whosoever loves and makes a lie.

D&C 76:104 These are they who suffer the wrath of God on earth.

D&C 76:105 These are they who suffer the vengeance of eternal fire.

D&C 76:106 These are they who are cast down to hell and suffer the wrath of Almighty God, until the fulness of times, when Christ shall have subdued all enemies under his feet, and shall have perfected his work;

D&C 76:107 When he shall deliver up the kingdom, and present it unto the Father, spotless, saying: I have overcome and have trodden the wine-press alone, even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God.

D&C 76:108 Then shall he be crowned with the crown of his glory, to sit on the throne of his power to reign forever and ever.

D&C 76:109 But behold, and lo, we saw the glory and the inhabitants of the telestial world, that they were as innumerable as the stars in the firmament of heaven, or as the sand upon the seashore;

D&C 76:110 And heard the voice of the Lord saying: These all shall bow the knee, and every tongue shall confess to him who sits upon the throne forever and ever;

D&C 76:111 For they shall be judged according to their works, and every man shall receive according to his own works, his own dominion, in the mansions which are prepared;

D&C 76:112 And they shall be servants of the Most High; but where God and Christ dwell they cannot come, worlds without end.

D&C 76:113 This is the end of the vision which we saw, which we were commanded to write while we were yet in the Spirit.

D&C 76:114 But great and marvelous are the works of the Lord, and the mysteries of his kingdom which he showed unto us, which surpass all understanding in glory, and in might, and in dominion;

D&C 76:115 Which he commanded us we should not write while we were yet in the Spirit, and are not lawful for man to utter;

D&C 76:116 Neither is man capable to make them known, for they are only to be seen and understood by the power of the Holy Spirit, which God bestows on those who love him, and purify themselves before him;

D&C 76:117 To whom he grants this privilege of seeing and knowing for themselves;

D&C 76:118 That through the power and manifestation of the Spirit, while in the flesh, they may be able to bear his presence in the world of glory.

D&C 76:119 And to God and the Lamb be glory, and honor, and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

D&C 77:0 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, March, 1832. --An explanation of part of the Revelation of John.

D&C 77:1 Q. What is the sea of glass spoken of by John, 4th chapter, and 6th verse of the Revelation? A. It is the earth, in its sanctified, immortal, and eternal state.

D&C 77:2 Q. What are we to understand by the four beasts, spoken of in the same verse? A. They are figurative expressions, used by the Revelator, John, in describing heaven, the paradise of God, the happiness of man, and of beasts, and of creeping things, and of the fowls of the air; that which is spiritual being in the likeness of that which is temporal; and that which is temporal in the likeness of that which is spiritual; the spirit of man in the likeness of his person, as also the spirit of the beast, and every other creature which God has created.

D&C 77:3 Q. Are the four beasts limited to individual beasts, or do they represent classes or orders? A. They are limited to four individual beasts, which were shown to John, to represent the glory of the classes of beings in their destined order or sphere of creation, in the enjoyment of their eternal felicity.

D&C 77:4 Q. What are we to understand by the eyes and wings, which the beasts had? A. Their eyes are a representation of light and knowledge, that is, they are full of knowledge; and their wings are a representation of power, to move, to act, etc.

D&C 77:5 Q. What are we to understand by the four and twenty elders, spoken of by John? A. We are to understand that these elders whom John saw, were elders who had been faithful in the work of the ministry and were dead; who belonged to the seven churches, and were then in the paradise of God.

D&C 77:6 Q. What are we to understand by the book which John saw, which was sealed on the back with seven seals? A. We are to understand that it contains the revealed will, mysteries, and the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence.

D&C 77:7 Q. What are we to understand by the seven seals with which it was sealed? A. We are to understand that the first seal contains the things of the first thousand years, and the second also of the second thousand years, and so on until the seventh.

D&C 77:8 Q. What are we to understand by the four angels, spoken of in the 7th chapter and 1st verse of Revelation? A. We are to understand that they are four angels sent forth from God, to whom is given power over the four parts of the earth, to save life and to destroy; these are they who have the everlasting gospel to commit to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; having power to shut up the heavens, to seal up unto life, or to cast down to the regions of darkness.

D&C 77:9 Q. What are we to understand by the angel ascending from the east, Revelation 7th chapter and 2nd verse? A. We are to understand that the angel ascending from the east is he to whom is given the seal of the living God over the twelve tribes of Israel; wherefore, he crieth unto the four angels having the everlasting gospel, saying: Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. And, if you will receive it, this is Elias which was to come to gather together the tribes of Israel and restore all things.

D&C 77:10 Q. What time are the things spoken of in this chapter to be accomplished? A. They are to be accomplished in the sixth thousand years, or the opening of the sixth seal.

D&C 77:11 Q. What are we to understand by sealing the one hundred and forty-four thousand, out of all the tribes of Israel--twelve thousand out of every tribe? A. We are to understand that those who are sealed are high priests, ordained unto the holy order of God, to administer the everlasting gospel; for they are they who are ordained out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, by the angels to whom is given power over the nations of the earth, to bring as many as will come to the church of the Firstborn.

D&C 77:12 Q. What are we to understand by the sounding of the trumpets, mentioned in the 8th chapter of Revelation? A. We are to understand that as God made the world in six days, and on the seventh day he finished his work, and sanctified it, and also formed man out of the dust of the earth, even so, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years will the Lord God sanctify the earth, and complete the salvation of man, and judge all things, and shall redeem all things, except that which he hath not put into his power, when he shall have sealed all things, unto the end of all things; and the sounding of the trumpets of the seven angels are the preparing and finishing of his work, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years--the preparing of the way before the time of his coming.

D&C 77:13 Q. When are the things to be accomplished, which are written in the 9th chapter of Revelation? A. They are to be accomplished after the opening of the seventh seal, before the coming of Christ.

D&C 77:14 Q. What are we to understand by the little book which was eaten by John, as mentioned in the 10th chapter of Revelation? A. We are to understand that it was a mission, and an ordinance, for him to gather the tribes of Israel; behold, this is Elias, who, as it is written, must come and restore all things.

D&C 77:15 Q. What is to be understood by the two witnesses, in the eleventh chapter of Revelation? A. They are two prophets that are to be raised up to the Jewish nation in the last days, at the time of the restoration, and to prophesy to the Jews after they are gathered and have built the city of Jerusalem in the land of their fathers.

D&C 78:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, March 1832. The Order given of the Lord to Enoch [Joseph Smith, Jun.] for the purpose of establishing the poor. In the documentary history of the Church, vol. 1, p. 255, appears this note: It was not always desirable that the individuals whom the Lord addressed in revelations should at the time be known by the world, and hence in this and in some subsequent revelations the brethren were addressed by other than their own names. The temporary necessity having passed for keeping the names of the individuals addressed unknown, their real names were subsequently given in brackets. --A fuller organization of the people for the regulation of their temporal affairs necessary--Spirit of equality among the Saints inculcated--Additional revelation from time to time to be given--Membership in the Church of the Firstborn defined.

D&C 78:1 The Lord spake unto Joseph Smith, Jun., saying: Hearken unto me, saith the Lord your God, who are ordained unto the high priesthood of my church, who have assembled yourselves together;

D&C 78:2 And listen to the counsel of him who has ordained you from on high, who shall speak in your ears the words of wisdom, that salvation may be unto you in that thing which you have presented before me, saith the Lord God.

D&C 78:3 For verily I say unto you, the time has come, and is now at hand; and behold, and lo, it must needs be that there be an organization of my people, in regulating and establishing the affairs of the storehouse for the poor of my people, both in this place and in the land of Zion--

D&C 78:4 For a permanent and everlasting establishment and order unto my church, to advance the cause, which ye have espoused, to the salvation of man, and to the glory of your Father who is in heaven;

D&C 78:5 That you may be equal in the bonds of heavenly things, yea, and earthly things also, for the obtaining of heavenly things.

D&C 78:6 For if ye are not equal in earthly things ye cannot be equal in obtaining heavenly things;

D&C 78:7 For if you will that I give unto you a place in the celestial world, you must prepare yourselves by doing the things which I have commanded you and required of you.

D&C 78:8 And now, verily thus saith the Lord, it is expedient that all things be done unto my glory, by you who are joined together in this order;

D&C 78:9 Or, in other words, let my servant Newel K. Whitney and my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and my servant Sidney Rigdon sit in council with the saints which are in Zion;

D&C 78:10 Otherwise Satan seeketh to turn their hearts away from the truth, that they become blinded and understand not the things which are prepared for them.

D&C 78:11 Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, to prepare and organize yourselves by a bond or everlasting covenant that cannot be broken.

D&C 78:12 And he who breaketh it shall lose his office and standing in the church, and shall be delivered over to the buffetings of Satan until the day of redemption.

D&C 78:13 Behold, this is the preparation wherewith I prepare you, and the foundation, and the ensample which I give unto you, whereby you may accomplish the commandments which are given you;

D&C 78:14 That through my providence, notwithstanding the tribulation which shall descend upon you, that the church may stand independent above all other creatures beneath the celestial world;

D&C 78:15 That you may come up unto the crown prepared for you, and be made rulers over many kingdoms, saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Zion, who hath established the foundations of Adam-ondi-Ahman;

D&C 78:16 Who hath appointed Michael your prince, and established his feet, and set him upon high, and given unto him the keys of salvation under the counsel and direction of the Holy One, who is without beginning of days or end of life.

D&C 78:17 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye are little children, and ye have not as yet understood how great blessings the Father hath in his own hands and prepared for you;

D&C 78:18 And ye cannot bear all things now; nevertheless, be of good cheer, for I will lead you along. The kingdom is yours and the blessings thereof are yours, and the riches of eternity are yours.

D&C 78:19 And he who receiveth all things with thankfulness shall be made glorious; and the things of this earth shall be added unto him, even an hundred fold, yea, more.

D&C 78:20 Wherefore, do the things which I have commanded you, saith your Redeemer, even the Son Ahman, who prepareth all things before he taketh you;

D&C 78:21 For ye are the church of the Firstborn, and he will take you up in a cloud, and appoint every man his portion.

D&C 78:22 And he that is a faithful and wise steward shall inherit all things. Amen.

D&C 79:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, March, 1832. --Jared Carter directed to go again into the eastern country--Conditional promise of great reward.

D&C 79:1 Verily I say unto you, that it is my will that my servant Jared Carter should go again into the eastern countries, from place to place, and from city to city, in the power of the ordination wherewith he has been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel.

D&C 79:2 And I will send upon him the Comforter, which shall teach him the truth and the way whither he shall go;

D&C 79:3 And inasmuch as he is faithful, I will crown him again with sheaves.

D&C 79:4 Wherefore, let your heart be glad, my servant Jared Carter, and fear not, saith your Lord, even Jesus Christ. Amen.

D&C 80:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, March, 1832. --Commandment concerning ministerial labors to Stephen Burnett and Eden Smith.

D&C 80:1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Stephen Burnett: Go ye, go ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature that cometh under the sound of your voice.

D&C 80:2 And inasmuch as you desire a companion, I will give unto you my servant Eden Smith.

D&C 80:3 Wherefore, go ye and preach my gospel, whether to the north or to the south, to the east or to the west, it mattereth not, for ye cannot go amiss.

D&C 80:4 Therefore, declare the things which ye have heard, and verily believe, and know to be true.

D&C 80:5 Behold, this is the will of him who hath called you, your Redeemer, even Jesus Christ. Amen.

D&C 81:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, March, 1832. --Frederick G. Williams called to be a High Priest and a Counselor in the First Presidency of the Church.

D&C 81:1 Verily, verily, I say unto you my servant Frederick G. Williams: Listen to the voice of him who speaketh, to the word of the Lord your God, and hearken to the calling wherewith you are called, even to be a high priest in my church, and a counselor unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.;

D&C 81:2 Unto whom I have given the keys of the kingdom, which belong always unto the Presidency of the High Priesthood:

D&C 81:3 Therefore, verily I acknowledge him and will bless him, and also thee, inasmuch as thou art faithful in counsel, in the office which I have appointed unto you, in prayer always, vocally and in thy heart, in public and in private, also in thy ministry in proclaiming the gospel in the land of the living, and among thy brethren.

D&C 81:4 And in doing these things thou wilt do the greatest good unto thy fellow beings, and wilt promote the glory of him who is your Lord.

D&C 81:5 Wherefore, be faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto you; succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.

D&C 81:6 And if thou art faithful unto the end thou shalt have a crown of immortality, and eternal life in the mansions which I have prepared in the house of my Father.

D&C 81:7 Behold, and lo, these are the words of Alpha and Omega, even Jesus Christ. Amen.

D&C 82:0 Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, in Jackson County, Missouri, April 26, 1832, showing the order given to Enoch, and the Church in his day. The occasion was a general council of the Church at which Joseph Smith the Prophet was sustained as the President of the High Priesthood, to which office he had previously been ordained at a conference of High Priests, Elders and members, at Amherst, Ohio, January 25, 1832. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 267. For explanation of unusual names see heading to Section 78. --The Lord reproves for sin and commends for repentance--Those who seek the mind of the Lord and then fail to abide by it are transgressors--The Lord is bound when his commandments are complied with--The Saints commanded to enter into covenant in the administration of their stewardships--Selfishness to be curbed and every man to seek the interest of his neighbor.

D&C 82:1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, my servants, that inasmuch as you have forgiven one another your trespasses, even so I, the Lord, forgive you.

D&C 82:2 Nevertheless, there are those among you who have sinned exceedingly; yea, even all of you have sinned; but verily I say unto you, beware from henceforth, and refrain from sin, lest sore judgments fall upon your heads.

D&C 82:3 For of him unto whom much is given much is required; and he who sins against the greater light shall receive the greater condemnation.

D&C 82:4 Ye call upon my name for revelations, and I give them unto you; and inasmuch as ye keep not my sayings, which I give unto you, ye become transgressors; and justice and judgment are the penalty which is affixed unto my law.

D&C 82:5 Therefore, what I say unto one I say unto all: Watch, for the adversary spreadeth his dominions, and darkness reigneth;

D&C 82:6 And the anger of God kindleth against the inhabitants of the earth; and none doeth good, for all have gone out of the way.

D&C 82:7 And now, verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, will not lay any sin to your charge; go your ways and sin no more; but unto that soul who sinneth shall the former sins return, saith the Lord your God.

D&C 82:8 And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a new commandment, that you may understand my will concerning you;

D&C 82:9 Or, in other words, I give unto you directions how you may act before me, that it may turn to you for your salvation.

D&C 82:10 I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.

D&C 82:11 Therefore, verily I say unto you, that it is expedient for my servants Edward Partridge and Newel K. Whitney, A. Sidney Gilbert and Sidney Rigdon, and my servant Joseph Smith, and John Whitmer and Oliver Cowdery, and W. W. Phelps and Martin Harris to be bound together by a bond and covenant that cannot be broken by transgression, except judgment shall immediately follow, in your several stewardships--

D&C 82:12 To manage the affairs of the poor, and all things pertaining to the bishopric both in the land of Zion and in the land of Kirtland;

D&C 82:13 For I have consecrated the land of Kirtland in mine own due time for the benefit of the saints of the Most High, and for a stake to Zion.

D&C 82:14 For Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments.

D&C 82:15 Therefore, I give unto you this commandment, that ye bind yourselves by this covenant, and it shall be done according to the laws of the Lord.

D&C 82:16 Behold, here is wisdom also in me for your good.

D&C 82:17 And you are to be equal, or in other words, you are to have equal claims on the properties, for the benefit of managing the concerns of your stewardships, every man according to his wants and his needs, inasmuch as his wants are just--

D&C 82:18 And all this for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold, to be cast into the Lord's storehouse, to become the common property of the whole church--

D&C 82:19 Every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God.

D&C 82:20 This order I have appointed to be an everlasting order unto you, and unto your successors, inasmuch as you sin not.

D&C 82:21 And the soul that sins against this covenant, and hardeneth his heart against it, shall be dealt with according to the laws of my church, and shall be delivered over to the buffetings of Satan until the day of redemption.

D&C 82:22 And now, verily I say unto you, and this is wisdom, make unto yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, and they will not destroy you.

D&C 82:23 Leave judgment alone with me, for it is mine and I will repay. Peace be with you; my blessings continue with you.

D&C 82:24 For even yet the kingdom is yours, and shall be forever, if you fall not from your steadfastness. Even so. Amen.

D&C 83:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Independence, Missouri, April 30, 1832. This revelation was received as the Prophet sat in council with his brethren. --Claims of women and children for support upon their husbands and fathers--Claims of widows and orphans upon the Church.

D&C 83:1 Verily, thus saith the Lord, in addition to the laws of the church concerning women and children, those who belong to the church, who have lost their husbands or fathers:

D&C 83:2 Women have claim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their husbands are taken; and if they are not found transgressors they shall have fellowship in the church.

D&C 83:3 And if they are not faithful they shall not have fellowship in the church; yet they may remain upon their inheritances according to the laws of the land.

D&C 83:4 All children have claim upon their parents for their maintenance until they are of age.

D&C 83:5 And after that, they have claim upon the church, or in other words upon the Lord's storehouse, if their parents have not wherewith to give them inheritances.

D&C 83:6 And the storehouse shall be kept by the consecrations of the church; and widows and orphans shall be provided for, as also the poor. Amen.

D&C 84:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, September 22 and 23, 1832. During the month of September, Elders had begun to return from their missions in the eastern States, and to make reports of their labors. It was while they were together in this season of joy that the following communication was received. The Prophet designates it a Revelation on Priesthood. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 286. --A Temple to be built in the land of Zion during this generation--The line of the Holy Priesthood from Moses back to Adam--Relation between the Holy Priesthood and the Lesser Priesthood--Bearers of these two Priesthoods called the sons of Moses and of Aaron respectively--Blessings and privileges of those who attain to these Priesthoods--The bondage of sin--The new and everlasting covenant--Gifts of the spirit specified--The Lord calls his servants, friends--Missionary service imperative--Plagues impending because of wickedness.

D&C 84:1 A revelation of Jesus Christ unto his servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and six elders, as they united their hearts and lifted their voices on high.

D&C 84:2 Yea, the word of the Lord concerning his church, established in the last days for the restoration of his people, as he has spoken by the mouth of his prophets, and for the gathering of his saints to stand upon Mount Zion, which shall be the city of New Jerusalem.

D&C 84:3 Which city shall be built, beginning at the temple lot, which is appointed by the finger of the Lord, in the western boundaries of the State of Missouri, and dedicated by the hand of Joseph Smith, Jun., and others with whom the Lord was well pleased.

D&C 84:4 Verily this is the word of the Lord, that the city New Jerusalem shall be built by the gathering of the saints, beginning at this place, even the place of the temple, which temple shall be reared in this generation.

D&C 84:5 For verily this generation shall not all pass away until an house shall be built unto the Lord, and a cloud shall rest upon it, which cloud shall be even the glory of the Lord, which shall fill the house.

D&C 84:6 And the sons of Moses, according to the Holy Priesthood which he received under the hand of his father-in-law, Jethro;

D&C 84:7 And Jethro received it under the hand of Caleb;

D&C 84:8 And Caleb received it under the hand of Elihu;

D&C 84:9 And Elihu under the hand of Jeremy;

D&C 84:10 And Jeremy under the hand of Gad;

D&C 84:11 And Gad under the hand of Esaias;

D&C 84:12 And Esaias received it under the hand of God.

D&C 84:13 Esaias also lived in the days of Abraham, and was blessed of him--

D&C 84:14 Which Abraham received the priesthood from Melchizedek, who received it through the lineage of his fathers, even till Noah;

D&C 84:15 And from Noah till Enoch, through the lineage of their fathers;

D&C 84:16 And from Enoch to Abel, who was slain by the conspiracy of his brother, who received the priesthood by the commandments of God, by the hand of his father Adam, who was the first man--

D&C 84:17 Which priesthood continueth in the church of God in all generations, and is without beginning of days or end of years.

D&C 84:18 And the Lord confirmed a priesthood also upon Aaron and his seed, throughout all their generations, which priesthood also continueth and abideth forever with the priesthood which is after the holiest order of God.

D&C 84:19 And this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God.

D&C 84:20 Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness is manifest.

D&C 84:21 And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh;

D&C 84:22 For without this no man can see the face of God, even the Father, and live.

D&C 84:23 Now this Moses plainly taught to the children of Israel in the wilderness, and sought diligently to sanctify his people that they might behold the face of God;

D&C 84:24 But they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory.

D&C 84:25 Therefore, he took Moses out of their midst, and the Holy Priesthood also;

D&C 84:26 And the lesser priesthood continued, which priesthood holdeth the key of the ministering of angels and the preparatory gospel;

D&C 84:27 Which gospel is the gospel of repentance and of baptism, and the remission of sins, and the law of carnal commandments, which the Lord in his wrath caused to continue with the house of Aaron among the children of Israel until John, whom God raised up, being filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb.

D&C 84:28 For he was baptized while he was yet in his childhood, and was ordained by the angel of God at the time he was eight days old unto this power, to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews, and to make straight the way of the Lord before the face of his people, to prepare them for the coming of the Lord, in whose hand is given all power.

D&C 84:29 And again, the offices of elder and bishop are necessary appendages belonging unto the high priesthood.

D&C 84:30 And again, the offices of teacher and deacon are necessary appendages belonging to the lesser priesthood, which priesthood was confirmed upon Aaron and his sons.

D&C 84:31 Therefore, as I said concerning the sons of Moses--for the sons of Moses and also the sons of Aaron shall offer an acceptable offering and sacrifice in the house of the Lord, which house shall be built unto the Lord in this generation, upon the consecrated spot as I have appointed--

D&C 84:32 And the sons of Moses and of Aaron shall be filled with the glory of the Lord, upon Mount Zion in the Lord's house, whose sons are ye; and also many whom I have called and sent forth to build up my church.

D&C 84:33 For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.

D&C 84:34 They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.

D&C 84:35 And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;

D&C 84:36 For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;

D&C 84:37 And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;

D&C 84:38 And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father's kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.

D&C 84:39 And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.

D&C 84:40 Therefore, all those who receive the priesthood, receive this oath and covenant of my Father, which he cannot break, neither can it be moved.

D&C 84:41 But whoso breaketh this covenant after he hath received it, and altogether turneth therefrom, shall not have forgiveness of sins in this world nor in the world to come.

D&C 84:42 And wo unto all those who come not unto this priesthood which ye have received, which I now confirm upon you who are present this day, by mine own voice out of the heavens; and even I have given the heavenly hosts and mine angels charge concerning you.

D&C 84:43 And I now give unto you a commandment to beware concerning yourselves, to give diligent heed to the words of eternal life.

D&C 84:44 For you shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of God.

D&C 84:45 For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ.

D&C 84:46 And the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit.

D&C 84:47 And every one that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spirit cometh unto God, even the Father.

D&C 84:48 And the Father teacheth him of the covenant which he has renewed and confirmed upon you, which is confirmed upon you for your sakes, and not for your sakes only, but for the sake of the whole world.

D&C 84:49 And the whole world lieth in sin, and groaneth under darkness and under the bondage of sin.

D&C 84:50 And by this you may know they are under the bondage of sin, because they come not unto me.

D&C 84:51 For whoso cometh not unto me is under the bondage of sin.

D&C 84:52 And whoso receiveth not my voice is not acquainted with my voice, and is not of me.

D&C 84:53 And by this you may know the righteous from the wicked, and that the whole world groaneth under sin and darkness even now.

D&C 84:54 And your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief, and because you have treated lightly the things you have received--

D&C 84:55 Which vanity and unbelief have brought the whole church under condemnation.

D&C 84:56 And this condemnation resteth upon the children of Zion, even all.

D&C 84:57 And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given them, not only to say, but to do according to that which I have written--

D&C 84:58 That they may bring forth fruit meet for their Father's kingdom; otherwise there remaineth a scourge and judgment to be poured out upon the children of Zion.

D&C 84:59 For shall the children of the kingdom pollute my holy land? Verily, I say unto you, Nay.

D&C 84:60 Verily, verily, I say unto you who now hear my words, which are my voice, blessed are ye inasmuch as you receive these things;

D&C 84:61 For I will forgive you of your sins with this commandment--that you remain steadfast in your minds in solemnity and the spirit of prayer, in bearing testimony to all the world of those things which are communicated unto you.

D&C 84:62 Therefore, go ye into all the world; and unto whatsoever place ye cannot go ye shall send, that the testimony may go from you into all the world unto every creature.

D&C 84:63 And as I said unto mine apostles, even so I say unto you, for you are mine apostles, even God's high priests; ye are they whom my Father hath given me; ye are my friends;

D&C 84:64 Therefore, as I said unto mine apostles I say unto you again, that every soul who believeth on your words, and is baptized by water for the remission of sins, shall receive the Holy Ghost.

D&C 84:65 And these signs shall follow them that believe--

D&C 84:66 In my name they shall do many wonderful works;

D&C 84:67 In my name they shall cast out devils;

D&C 84:68 In my name they shall heal the sick;

D&C 84:69 In my name they shall open the eyes of the blind, and unstop the ears of the deaf;

D&C 84:70 And the tongue of the dumb shall speak;

D&C 84:71 And if any man shall administer poison unto them it shall not hurt them;

D&C 84:72 And the poison of a serpent shall not have power to harm them.

D&C 84:73 But a commandment I give unto them, that they shall not boast themselves of these things, neither speak them before the world; for these things are given unto you for your profit and for salvation.

D&C 84:74 Verily, verily, I say unto you, they who believe not on your words, and are not baptized in water in my name, for the remission of their sins, that they may receive the Holy Ghost, shall be damned, and shall not come into my Father's kingdom where my Father and I am.

D&C 84:75 And this revelation unto you, and commandment, is in force from this very hour upon all the world, and the gospel is unto all who have not received it.

D&C 84:76 But, verily I say unto all those to whom the kingdom has been given--from you it must be preached unto them, that they shall repent of their former evil works; for they are to be upbraided for their evil hearts of unbelief, and your brethren in Zion for their rebellion against you at the time I sent you.

D&C 84:77 And again I say unto you, my friends, for from henceforth I shall call you friends, it is expedient that I give unto you this commandment, that ye become even as my friends in days when I was with them, traveling to preach the gospel in my power;

D&C 84:78 For I suffered them not to have purse or scrip, neither two coats.

D&C 84:79 Behold, I send you out to prove the world, and the laborer is worthy of his hire.

D&C 84:80 And any man that shall go and preach this gospel of the kingdom, and fail not to continue faithful in all things, shall not be weary in mind, neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint; and a hair of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed. And they shall not go hungry, neither athirst.

D&C 84:81 Therefore, take ye no thought for the morrow, for what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, or wherewithal ye shall be clothed.

D&C 84:82 For, consider the lilies of the field, how they grow, they toil not, neither do they spin; and the kingdoms of the world, in all their glory, are not arrayed like one of these.

D&C 84:83 For your Father, who is in heaven, knoweth that you have need of all these things.

D&C 84:84 Therefore, let the morrow take thought for the things of itself.

D&C 84:85 Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man.

D&C 84:86 Therefore, let no man among you, for this commandment is unto all the faithful who are called of God in the church unto the ministry, from this hour take purse or scrip, that goeth forth to proclaim this gospel of the kingdom.

D&C 84:87 Behold, I send you out to reprove the world of all their unrighteous deeds, and to teach them of a judgment which is to come.

D&C 84:88 And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.

D&C 84:89 Whoso receiveth you receiveth me; and the same will feed you, and clothe you, and give you money.

D&C 84:90 And he who feeds you, or clothes you, or gives you money, shall in nowise lose his reward.

D&C 84:91 And he that doeth not these things is not my disciple; by this you may know my disciples.

D&C 84:92 He that receiveth you not, go away from him alone by yourselves, and cleanse your feet even with water, pure water, whether in heat or in cold, and bear testimony of it unto your Father which is in heaven, and return not again unto that man.

D&C 84:93 And in whatsoever village or city ye enter, do likewise.

D&C 84:94 Nevertheless, search diligently and spare not; and wo unto that house, or that village or city that rejecteth you, or your words, or your testimony concerning me.

D&C 84:95 Wo, I say again, unto that house, or that village or city that rejecteth you, or your words, or your testimony of me;

D&C 84:96 For I, the Almighty, have laid my hands upon the nations, to scourge them for their wickedness.

D&C 84:97 And plagues shall go forth, and they shall not be taken from the earth until I have completed my work, which shall be cut short in righteousness--

D&C 84:98 Until all shall know me, who remain, even from the least unto the greatest, and shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, and shall see eye to eye, and shall lift up their voice, and with the voice together sing this new song, saying:

D&C 84:99 The Lord hath brought again Zion; The Lord hath redeemed his people, Israel, According to the election of grace, Which was brought to pass by the faith And covenant of their fathers.

D&C 84:100 The Lord hath redeemed his people; And Satan is bound and time is no longer. The Lord hath gathered all things in one. The Lord hath brought down Zion from above. The Lord hath brought up Zion from beneath.

D&C 84:101 The earth hath travailed and brought forth her strength; And truth is established in her bowels; And the heavens have smiled upon her; And she is clothed with the glory of her God; For he stands in the midst of his people.

D&C 84:102 Glory, and honor, and power, and might, Be ascribed to our God; for he is full of mercy, Justice, grace and truth, and peace, Forever and ever, Amen.

D&C 84:103 And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, it is expedient that every man who goes forth to proclaim mine everlasting gospel, that inasmuch as they have families, and receive money by gift, that they should send it unto them or make use of it for their benefit, as the Lord shall direct them, for thus it seemeth me good.

D&C 84:104 And let all those who have not families, who receive money, send it up unto the bishop in Zion, or unto the bishop in Ohio, that it may be consecrated for the bringing forth of the revelations and the printing thereof, and for establishing Zion.

D&C 84:105 And if any man shall give unto any of you a coat, or a suit, take the old and cast it unto the poor, and go on your way rejoicing.

D&C 84:106 And if any man among you be strong in the Spirit, let him take with him him that is weak, that he may be edified in all meekness, that he may become strong also.

D&C 84:107 Therefore, take with you those who are ordained unto the lesser priesthood, and send them before you to make appointments, and to prepare the way, and to fill appointments that you yourselves are not able to fill.

D&C 84:108 Behold, this is the way that mine apostles, in ancient days, built up my church unto me.

D&C 84:109 Therefore, let every man stand in his own office, and labor in his own calling; and let not the head say unto the feet it hath no need of the feet; for without the feet how shall the body be able to stand?

D&C 84:110 Also the body hath need of every member, that all may be edified together, that the system may be kept perfect.

D&C 84:111 And behold, the high priests should travel, and also the elders, and also the lesser priests; but the deacons and teachers should be appointed to watch over the church, to be standing ministers unto the church.

D&C 84:112 And the bishop, Newel K. Whitney, also should travel round about and among all the churches, searching after the poor to administer to their wants by humbling the rich and the proud.

D&C 84:113 He should also employ an agent to take charge and to do his secular business as he shall direct.

D&C 84:114 Nevertheless, let the bishop go unto the city of New York, also to the city of Albany, and also to the city of Boston, and warn the people of those cities with the sound of the gospel, with a loud voice, of the desolation and utter abolishment which await them if they do reject these things.

D&C 84:115 For if they do reject these things the hour of their judgment is nigh, and their house shall be left unto them desolate.

D&C 84:116 Let him trust in me and he shall not be confounded; and a hair of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed.

D&C 84:117 And verily I say unto you, the rest of my servants, go ye forth as your circumstances shall permit, in your several callings, unto the great and notable cities and villages, reproving the world in righteousness of all their unrighteous and ungodly deeds, setting forth clearly and understandingly the desolation of abomination in the last days.

D&C 84:118 For, with you saith the Lord Almighty, I will rend their kingdoms; I will not only shake the earth, but the starry heavens shall tremble.

D&C 84:119 For I, the Lord, have put forth my hand to exert the powers of heaven; ye cannot see it now, yet a little while and ye shall see it, and know that I am, and that I will come and reign with my people.

D&C 84:120 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. Amen.

D&C 85:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, November 27, 1832, concerning the Saints in Zion, Missouri. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 298. --Inheritances in Zion to be received through consecration--Provision made for the assignment of inheritances among the Saints.

D&C 85:1 It is the duty of the Lord's clerk, whom he has appointed, to keep a history, and a general church record of all things that transpire in Zion, and of all those who consecrate properties, and receive inheritances legally from the bishop;

D&C 85:2 And also their manner of life, their faith, and works; and also of the apostates who apostatize after receiving their inheritances.

D&C 85:3 It is contrary to the will and commandment of God that those who receive not their inheritance by consecration, agreeable to his law, which he has given, that he may tithe his people, to prepare them against the day of vengeance and burning, should have their names enrolled with the people of God.

D&C 85:4 Neither is their genealogy to be kept, or to be had where it may be found on any of the records or history of the church.

D&C 85:5 Their names shall not be found, neither the names of the fathers, nor the names of the children written in the book of the law of God, saith the Lord of Hosts.

D&C 85:6 Yea, thus saith the still small voice, which whispereth through and pierceth all things, and often times it maketh my bones to quake while it maketh manifest, saying:

D&C 85:7 And it shall come to pass that I, the Lord God, will send one mighty and strong, holding the scepter of power in his hand, clothed with light for a covering, whose mouth shall utter words, eternal words; while his bowels shall be a fountain of truth, to set in order the house of God, and to arrange by lot the inheritances of the saints whose names are found, and the names of their fathers, and of their children, enrolled in the book of the law of God;

D&C 85:8 While that man, who was called of God and appointed, that putteth forth his hand to steady the ark of God, shall fall by the shaft of death, like as a tree that is smitten by the vivid shaft of lightning.

D&C 85:9 And all they who are not found written in the book of remembrance shall find none inheritance in that day, but they shall be cut asunder, and their portion shall be appointed them among unbelievers, where are wailing and gnashing of teeth.

D&C 85:10 These things I say not of myself; therefore, as the Lord speaketh, he will also fulfil.

D&C 85:11 And they who are of the High Priesthood, whose names are not found written in the book of the law, or that are found to have apostatized, or to have been cut off from the church, as well as the lesser priesthood, or the members, in that day shall not find an inheritance among the saints of the Most High;

D&C 85:12 Therefore, it shall be done unto them as unto the children of the priest, as will be found recorded in the second chapter and sixty-first and second verses of Ezra.

D&C 86:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, December 6, 1832. --Exposition of the Lord's parable concerning the wheat and the tares--Its application to the latter days.

D&C 86:1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servants, concerning the parable of the wheat and of the tares:

D&C 86:2 Behold, verily I say, the field was the world, and the apostles were the sowers of the seed;

D&C 86:3 And after they have fallen asleep the great persecutor of the church, the apostate, the whore, even Babylon, that maketh all nations to drink of her cup, in whose hearts the enemy, even Satan, sitteth to reign--behold he soweth the tares; wherefore, the tares choke the wheat and drive the church into the wilderness.

D&C 86:4 But behold, in the last days, even now while the Lord is beginning to bring forth the word, and the blade is springing up and is yet tender--

D&C 86:5 Behold, verily I say unto you, the angels are crying unto the Lord day and night, who are ready and waiting to be sent forth to reap down the fields;

D&C 86:6 But the Lord saith unto them, pluck not up the tares while the blade is yet tender (for verily your faith is weak), lest you destroy the wheat also.

D&C 86:7 Therefore, let the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest is fully ripe; then ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares, and after the gathering of the wheat, behold and lo, the tares are bound in bundles, and the field remaineth to be burned.

D&C 86:8 Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your fathers--

D&C 86:9 For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the world with Christ in God--

D&C 86:10 Therefore your life and the priesthood have remained, and must needs remain through you and your lineage until the restoration of all things spoken by the mouths of all the holy prophets since the world began.

D&C 86:11 Therefore, blessed are ye if ye continue in my goodness, a light unto the Gentiles, and through this priesthood, a savior unto my people Israel. The Lord hath said it. Amen.

D&C 87:0 Revelation and Prophecy on War, given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, December 25, 1832. --Wars predicted--Division between the Northern States and the Southern States--Great calamities in manifestation of the chastening hand of God.

D&C 87:1 Verily, thus saith the Lord concerning the wars that will shortly come to pass, beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina, which will eventually terminate in the death and misery of many souls;

D&C 87:2 And the time will come that war will be poured out upon all nations, beginning at this place.

D&C 87:3 For behold, the Southern States shall be divided against the Northern States, and the Southern States will call on other nations, even the nation of Great Britain, as it is called, and they shall also call upon other nations, in order to defend themselves against other nations; and then war shall be poured out upon all nations.

D&C 87:4 And it shall come to pass, after many days, slaves shall rise up against their masters, who shall be marshaled and disciplined for war.

D&C 87:5 And it shall come to pass also that the remnants who are left of the land will marshal themselves, and shall become exceedingly angry, and shall vex the Gentiles with a sore vexation.

D&C 87:6 And thus, with the sword and by bloodshed the inhabitants of the earth shall mourn; and with famine, and plague, and earthquake, and the thunder of heaven, and the fierce and vivid lightning also, shall the inhabitants of the earth be made to feel the wrath, and indignation, and chastening hand of an Almighty God, until the consumption decreed hath made a full end of all nations;

D&C 87:7 That the cry of the saints, and of the blood of the saints, shall cease to come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, from the earth, to be avenged of their enemies.

D&C 87:8 Wherefore, stand ye in holy places, and be not moved, until the day of the Lord come; for behold, it cometh quickly, saith the Lord. Amen.

D&C 88:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, December 27, 1832. Designated by the Prophet, the Olive Leaf. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 302. --Ministrations of the Comforter--The light of truth is the light of Christ--The spirit and the body constitute the soul--Parable of the man sending his servants into the field and visiting them in turn--Search for the truth through study and prayer enjoined--Testimony of the Elders to be followed by that calamity--Scenes incident to the Lord's coming--The angels sounding their trumpets in turn as appointed--Duties of the Presidency of the School of the Prophets--The ordinance of washing of feet.

D&C 88:1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you who have assembled yourselves together to receive his will concerning you:

D&C 88:2 Behold, this is pleasing unto your Lord, and the angels rejoice over you; the alms of your prayers have come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, and are recorded in the book of the names of the sanctified, even them of the celestial world.

D&C 88:3 Wherefore, I now send upon you another Comforter, even upon you my friends, that it may abide in your hearts, even the Holy Spirit of promise; which other Comforter is the same that I promised unto my disciples, as is recorded in the testimony of John.

D&C 88:4 This Comforter is the promise which I give unto you of eternal life, even the glory of the celestial kingdom;

D&C 88:5 Which glory is that of the church of the Firstborn, even of God, the holiest of all, through Jesus Christ his Son--

D&C 88:6 He that ascended up on high, as also he descended below all things, in that he comprehended all things, that he might be in all and through all things, the light of truth;

D&C 88:7 Which truth shineth. This is the light of Christ. As also he is in the sun, and the light of the sun, and the power thereof by which it was made.

D&C 88:8 As also he is in the moon, and is the light of the moon, and the power thereof by which it was made;

D&C 88:9 As also the light of the stars, and the power thereof by which they were made;

D&C 88:10 And the earth also, and the power thereof, even the earth upon which you stand.

D&C 88:11 And the light which shineth, which giveth you light, is through him who enlighteneth your eyes, which is the same light that quickeneth your understandings;

D&C 88:12 Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space--

D&C 88:13 The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God who sitteth upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all things.

D&C 88:14 Now, verily I say unto you, that through the redemption which is made for you is brought to pass the resurrection from the dead.

D&C 88:15 And the spirit and the body are the soul of man.

D&C 88:16 And the resurrection from the dead is the redemption of the soul.

D&C 88:17 And the redemption of the soul is through him that quickeneth all things, in whose bosom it is decreed that the poor and the meek of the earth shall inherit it.

D&C 88:18 Therefore, it must needs be sanctified from all unrighteousness, that it may be prepared for the celestial glory;

D&C 88:19 For after it hath filled the measure of its creation, it shall be crowned with glory, even with the presence of God the Father;

D&C 88:20 That bodies who are of the celestial kingdom may possess it forever and ever; for, for this intent was it made and created, and for this intent are they sanctified.

D&C 88:21 And they who are not sanctified through the law which I have given unto you, even the law of Christ, must inherit another kingdom, even that of a terrestrial kingdom, or that of a telestial kingdom.

D&C 88:22 For he who is not able to abide the law of a celestial kingdom cannot abide a celestial glory.

D&C 88:23 And he who cannot abide the law of a terrestrial kingdom cannot abide a terrestrial glory.

D&C 88:24 And he who cannot abide the law of a telestial kingdom cannot abide a telestial glory; therefore he is not meet for a kingdom of glory. Therefore he must abide a kingdom which is not a kingdom of glory.

D&C 88:25 And again, verily I say unto you, the earth abideth the law of a celestial kingdom, for it filleth the measure of its creation, and transgresseth not the law--

D&C 88:26 Wherefore, it shall be sanctified; yea, notwithstanding it shall die, it shall be quickened again, and shall abide the power by which it is quickened, and the righteous shall inherit it.

D&C 88:27 For notwithstanding they die, they also shall rise again, a spiritual body.

D&C 88:28 They who are of a celestial spirit shall receive the same body which was a natural body; even ye shall receive your bodies, and your glory shall be that glory by which your bodies are quickened.

D&C 88:29 Ye who are quickened by a portion of the celestial glory shall then receive of the same, even a fulness.

D&C 88:30 And they who are quickened by a portion of the terrestrial glory shall then receive of the same, even a fulness.

D&C 88:31 And also they who are quickened by a portion of the telestial glory shall then receive of the same, even a fulness.

D&C 88:32 And they who remain shall also be quickened; nevertheless, they shall return again to their own place, to enjoy that which they are willing to receive, because they were not willing to enjoy that which they might have received.

D&C 88:33 For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift.

D&C 88:34 And again, verily I say unto you, that which is governed by law is also preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same.

D&C 88:35 That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, nor judgment. Therefore, they must remain filthy still.

D&C 88:36 All kingdoms have a law given;

D&C 88:37 And there are many kingdoms; for there is no space in the which there is no kingdom; and there is no kingdom in which there is no space, either a greater or a lesser kingdom.

D&C 88:38 And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions.

D&C 88:39 All beings who abide not in those conditions are not justified.

D&C 88:40 For intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light; mercy hath compassion on mercy and claimeth her own; justice continueth its course and claimeth its own; judgment goeth before the face of him who sitteth upon the throne and governeth and executeth all things.

D&C 88:41 He comprehendeth all things, and all things are before him, and all things are round about him; and he is above all things, and in all things, and is through all things, and is round about all things; and all things are by him, and of him, even God, forever and ever.

D&C 88:42 And again, verily I say unto you, he hath given a law unto all things, by which they move in their times and their seasons;

D&C 88:43 And their courses are fixed, even the courses of the heavens and the earth, which comprehend the earth and all the planets.

D&C 88:44 And they give light to each other in their times and in their seasons, in their minutes, in their hours, in their days, in their weeks, in their months, in their years--all these are one year with God, but not with man.

D&C 88:45 The earth rolls upon her wings, and the sun giveth his light by day, and the moon giveth her light by night, and the stars also give their light, as they roll upon their wings in their glory, in the midst of the power of God.

D&C 88:46 Unto what shall I liken these kingdoms, that ye may understand?

D&C 88:47 Behold, all these are kingdoms, and any man who hath seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power.

D&C 88:48 I say unto you, he hath seen him; nevertheless, he who came unto his own was not comprehended.

D&C 88:49 The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not; nevertheless, the day shall come when you shall comprehend even God, being quickened in him and by him.

D&C 88:50 Then shall ye know that ye have seen me, that I am, and that I am the true light that is in you, and that you are in me; otherwise ye could not abound.

D&C 88:51 Behold, I will liken these kingdoms unto a man having a field, and he sent forth his servants into the field to dig in the field.

D&C 88:52 And he said unto the first: Go ye and labor in the field, and in the first hour I will come unto you, and ye shall behold the joy of my countenance.

D&C 88:53 And he said unto the second: Go ye also into the field, and in the second hour I will visit you with the joy of my countenance.

D&C 88:54 And also unto the third, saying: I will visit you;

D&C 88:55 And unto the fourth, and so on unto the twelfth.

D&C 88:56 And the lord of the field went unto the first in the first hour, and tarried with him all that hour, and he was made glad with the light of the countenance of his lord.

D&C 88:57 And then he withdrew from the first that he might visit the second also, and the third, and the fourth, and so on unto the twelfth.

D&C 88:58 And thus they all received the light of the countenance of their lord, every man in his hour, and in his time, and in his season--

D&C 88:59 Beginning at the first, and so on unto the last, and from the last unto the first, and from the first unto the last;

D&C 88:60 Every man in his own order, until his hour was finished, even according as his lord had commanded him, that his lord might be glorified in him, and he in his lord, that they all might be glorified.

D&C 88:61 Therefore, unto this parable I will liken all these kingdoms, and the inhabitants thereof--every kingdom in its hour, and in its time, and in its season, even according to the decree which God hath made.

D&C 88:62 And again, verily I say unto you, my friends, I leave these sayings with you to ponder in your hearts, with this commandment which I give unto you, that ye shall call upon me while I am near--

D&C 88:63 Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

D&C 88:64 Whatsoever ye ask the Father in my name it shall be given unto you, that is expedient for you;

D&C 88:65 And if ye ask anything that is not expedient for you, it shall turn unto your condemnation.

D&C 88:66 Behold, that which you hear is as the voice of one crying in the wilderness--in the wilderness, because you cannot see him--my voice, because my voice is Spirit; my Spirit is truth; truth abideth and hath no end; and if it be in you it shall abound.

D&C 88:67 And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.

D&C 88:68 Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will.

D&C 88:69 Remember the great and last promise which I have made unto you; cast away your idle thoughts and your excess of laughter far from you.

D&C 88:70 Tarry ye, tarry ye in this place, and call a solemn assembly, even of those who are the first laborers in this last kingdom.

D&C 88:71 And let those whom they have warned in their traveling call on the Lord, and ponder the warning in their hearts which they have received, for a little season.

D&C 88:72 Behold, and lo, I will take care of your flocks, and will raise up elders and send unto them.

D&C 88:73 Behold, I will hasten my work in its time.

D&C 88:74 And I give unto you, who are the first laborers in this last kingdom, a commandment that you assemble yourselves together, and organize yourselves, and prepare yourselves, and sanctify yourselves; yea, purify your hearts, and cleanse your hands and your feet before me, that I may make you clean;

D&C 88:75 That I may testify unto your Father, and your God, and my God, that you are clean from the blood of this wicked generation; that I may fulfil this promise, this great and last promise, which I have made unto you, when I will.

D&C 88:76 Also, I give unto you a commandment that ye shall continue in prayer and fasting from this time forth.

D&C 88:77 And I give unto you a commandment that you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.

D&C 88:78 Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;

D&C 88:79 Of things both in heaven and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of kingdoms--

D&C 88:80 That ye may be prepared in all things when I shall send you again to magnify the calling whereunto I have called you, and the mission with which I have commissioned you.

D&C 88:81 Behold, I sent you out to testify and warn the people, and it becometh every man who hath been warned to warn his neighbor.

D&C 88:82 Therefore, they are left without excuse, and their sins are upon their own heads.

D&C 88:83 He that seeketh me early shall find me, and shall not be forsaken.

D&C 88:84 Therefore, tarry ye, and labor diligently, that you may be perfected in your ministry to go forth among the Gentiles for the last time, as many as the mouth of the Lord shall name, to bind up the law and seal up the testimony, and to prepare the saints for the hour of judgment which is to come;

D&C 88:85 That their souls may escape the wrath of God, the desolation of abomination which awaits the wicked, both in this world and in the world to come. Verily, I say unto you, let those who are not the first elders continue in the vineyard until the mouth of the Lord shall call them, for their time is not yet come; their garments are not clean from the blood of this generation.

D&C 88:86 Abide ye in the liberty wherewith ye are made free; entangle not yourselves in sin, but let your hands be clean, until the Lord comes.

D&C 88:87 For not many days hence and the earth shall tremble and reel to and fro as a drunken man; and the sun shall hide his face, and shall refuse to give light; and the moon shall be bathed in blood; and the stars shall become exceedingly angry, and shall cast themselves down as a fig that falleth from off a fig-tree.

D&C 88:88 And after your testimony cometh wrath and indignation upon the people.

D&C 88:89 For after your testimony cometh the testimony of earthquakes, that shall cause groanings in the midst of her, and men shall fall upon the ground and shall not be able to stand.

D&C 88:90 And also cometh the testimony of the voice of thunderings, and the voice of lightnings, and the voice of tempests, and the voice of the waves of the sea heaving themselves beyond their bounds.

D&C 88:91 And all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men's hearts shall fail them; for fear shall come upon all people.

D&C 88:92 And angels shall fly through the midst of heaven, crying with a loud voice, sounding the trump of God, saying: Prepare ye, prepare ye, O inhabitants of the earth; for the judgment of our God is come. Behold, and lo, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.

D&C 88:93 And immediately there shall appear a great sign in heaven, and all people shall see it together.

D&C 88:94 And another angel shall sound his trump, saying: That great church, the mother of abominations, that made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, that persecuteth the saints of God, that shed their blood--she who sitteth upon many waters, and upon the islands of the sea--behold, she is the tares of the earth; she is bound in bundles; her bands are made strong, no man can loose them; therefore, she is ready to be burned. And he shall sound his trump both long and loud, and all nations shall hear it.

D&C 88:95 And there shall be silence in heaven for the space of half an hour; and immediately after shall the curtain of heaven be unfolded, as a scroll is unfolded after it is rolled up, and the face of the Lord shall be unveiled;

D&C 88:96 And the saints that are upon the earth, who are alive, shall be quickened and be caught up to meet him.

D&C 88:97 And they who have slept in their graves shall come forth, for their graves shall be opened; and they also shall be caught up to meet him in the midst of the pillar of heaven--

D&C 88:98 They are Christ's, the first fruits, they who shall descend with him first, and they who are on the earth and in their graves, who are first caught up to meet him; and all this by the voice of the sounding of the trump of the angel of God.

D&C 88:99 And after this another angel shall sound, which is the second trump; and then cometh the redemption of those who are Christ's at his coming; who have received their part in that prison which is prepared for them, that they might receive the gospel, and be judged according to men in the flesh.

D&C 88:100 And again, another trump shall sound, which is the third trump; and then come the spirits of men who are to be judged, and are found under condemnation;

D&C 88:101 And these are the rest of the dead; and they live not again until the thousand years are ended, neither again, until the end of the earth.

D&C 88:102 And another trump shall sound, which is the fourth trump, saying: There are found among those who are to remain until that great and last day, even the end, who shall remain filthy still.

D&C 88:103 And another trump shall sound, which is the fifth trump, which is the fifth angel who committeth the everlasting gospel--flying through the midst of heaven, unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people;

D&C 88:104 And this shall be the sound of his trump, saying to all people, both in heaven and in earth, and that are under the earth--for every ear shall hear it, and every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall confess, while they hear the sound of the trump, saying: Fear God, and give glory to him who sitteth upon the throne, forever and ever; for the hour of his judgment is come.

D&C 88:105 And again, another angel shall sound his trump, which is the sixth angel, saying: She is fallen who made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication; she is fallen, is fallen!

D&C 88:106 And again, another angel shall sound his trump, which is the seventh angel, saying: It is finished; it is finished! The Lamb of God hath overcome and trodden the wine-press alone, even the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God.

D&C 88:107 And then shall the angels be crowned with the glory of his might, and the saints shall be filled with his glory, and receive their inheritance and be made equal with him.

D&C 88:108 And then shall the first angel again sound his trump in the ears of all living, and reveal the secret acts of men, and the mighty works of God in the first thousand years.

D&C 88:109 And then shall the second angel sound his trump, and reveal the secret acts of men, and the thoughts and intents of their hearts, and the mighty works of God in the second thousand years--

D&C 88:110 And so on, until the seventh angel shall sound his trump; and he shall stand forth upon the land and upon the sea, and swear in the name of him who sitteth upon the throne, that there shall be time no longer; and Satan shall be bound, that old serpent, who is called the devil, and shall not be loosed for the space of a thousand years.

D&C 88:111 And then he shall be loosed for a little season, that he may gather together his armies.

D&C 88:112 And Michael, the seventh angel, even the archangel, shall gather together his armies, even the hosts of heaven.

D&C 88:113 And the devil shall gather together his armies; even the hosts of hell, and shall come up to battle against Michael and his armies.

D&C 88:114 And then cometh the battle of the great God; and the devil and his armies shall be cast away into their own place, that they shall not have power over the saints any more at all.

D&C 88:115 For Michael shall fight their battles, and shall overcome him who seeketh the throne of him who sitteth upon the throne, even the Lamb.

D&C 88:116 This is the glory of God, and the sanctified; and they shall not any more see death.

D&C 88:117 Therefore, verily I say unto you, my friends, call your solemn assembly, as I have commanded you.

D&C 88:118 And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.

D&C 88:119 Organize yourselves; prepare every needful thing; and establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God;

D&C 88:120 That your incomings may be in the name of the Lord; that your outgoings may be in the name of the Lord; that all your salutations may be in the name of the Lord, with uplifted hands unto the Most High.

D&C 88:121 Therefore, cease from all your light speeches, from all laughter, from all your lustful desires, from all your pride and light-mindedness, and from all your wicked doings.

D&C 88:122 Appoint among yourselves a teacher, and let not all be spokesmen at once; but let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege.

D&C 88:123 See that ye love one another; cease to be covetous; learn to impart one to another as the gospel requires.

D&C 88:124 Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.

D&C 88:125 And above all things, clothe yourselves with the bond of charity, as with a mantle, which is the bond of perfectness and peace.

D&C 88:126 Pray always, that ye may not faint, until I come. Behold, and lo, I will come quickly, and receive you unto myself. Amen.

D&C 88:127 And again, the order of the house prepared for the presidency of the school of the prophets, established for their instruction in all things that are expedient for them, even for all the officers of the church, or in other words, those who are called to the ministry in the church, beginning at the high priests, even down to the deacons--

D&C 88:128 And this shall be the order of the house of the presidency of the school: He that is appointed to be president, or teacher, shall be found standing in his place, in the house which shall be prepared for him.

D&C 88:129 Therefore, he shall be first in the house of God, in a place that the congregation in the house may hear his words carefully and distinctly, not with loud speech.

D&C 88:130 And when he cometh into the house of God, for he should be first in the house--behold, this is beautiful, that he may be an example--

D&C 88:131 Let him offer himself in prayer upon his knees before God, in token or remembrance of the everlasting covenant.

D&C 88:132 And when any shall come in after him, let the teacher arise, and, with uplifted hands to heaven, yea, even directly, salute his brother or brethren with these words:

D&C 88:133 Art thou a brother or brethren? I salute you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, in token or remembrance of the everlasting covenant, in which covenant I receive you to fellowship, in a determination that is fixed, immovable, and unchangeable, to be your friend and brother through the grace of God in the bonds of love, to walk in all the commandments of God blameless, in thanksgiving, forever and ever. Amen.

D&C 88:134 And he that is found unworthy of this salutation shall not have place among you; for ye shall not suffer that mine house shall be polluted by him.

D&C 88:135 And he that cometh in and is faithful before me, and is a brother, or if they be brethren, they shall salute the president or teacher with uplifted hands to heaven, with this same prayer and covenant, or by saying Amen, in token of the same.

D&C 88:136 Behold, verily, I say unto you, this is an ensample unto you for a salutation to one another in the house of God, in the school of the prophets.

D&C 88:137 And ye are called to do this by prayer and thanksgiving, as the Spirit shall give utterance in all your doings in the house of the Lord, in the school of the prophets, that it may become a sanctuary, a tabernacle of the Holy Spirit to your edification.

D&C 88:138 And ye shall not receive any among you into this school save he is clean from the blood of this generation;

D&C 88:139 And he shall be received by the ordinance of the washing of feet, for unto this end was the ordinance of the washing of feet instituted.

D&C 88:140 And again, the ordinance of washing feet is to be administered by the president, or presiding elder of the church.

D&C 88:141 It is to be commenced with prayer; and after partaking of bread and wine, he is to gird himself according to the pattern given in the thirteenth chapter of John's testimony concerning me. Amen.

D&C 89:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, February 27, 1833, known as the Word of Wisdom. --Abstinence from wine, strong drink, tobacco and hot drinks enjoined--Moderation in the eating of meat--Wholesome foods--Promises to those who live according to these precepts.

D&C 89:1 A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, assembled in Kirtland, and the church, and also the saints in Zion--

D&C 89:2 To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days--

D&C 89:3 Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints.

D&C 89:4 Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation--

D&C 89:5 That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him.

D&C 89:6 And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the vine, of your own make.

D&C 89:7 And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of your bodies.

D&C 89:8 And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill.

D&C 89:9 And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly.

D&C 89:10 And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man--

D&C 89:11 Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving.

D&C 89:12 Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly;

D&C 89:13 And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine.

D&C 89:14 All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth;

D&C 89:15 And these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine and excess of hunger.

D&C 89:16 All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine; that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground--

D&C 89:17 Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grain.

D&C 89:18 And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones;

D&C 89:19 And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures;

D&C 89:20 And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint.

D&C 89:21 And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroying angel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen.

D&C 90:0 Revelation to Joseph Smith the Prophet, given at Kirtland, Ohio, March 8, 1833. Position of Joseph as President of the Church reaffirmed. --Accountability of those who receive the oracles of God--The Gospel to be preached throughout the world--Worthy servants commended and offenders reproved.

D&C 90:1 Thus saith the Lord, verily, verily I say unto you my son, thy sins are forgiven thee, according to thy petition, for thy prayers and the prayers of thy brethren have come up into my ears.

D&C 90:2 Therefore, thou art blessed from henceforth that bear the keys of the kingdom given unto you; which kingdom is coming forth for the last time.

D&C 90:3 Verily I say unto you, the keys of this kingdom shall never be taken from you, while thou art in the world, neither in the world to come;

D&C 90:4 Nevertheless, through you shall the oracles be given to another, yea, even unto the church.

D&C 90:5 And all they who receive the oracles of God, let them beware how they hold them lest they are accounted as a light thing, and are brought under condemnation thereby, and stumble and fall when the storms descend, and the winds blow, and the rains descend, and beat upon their house.

D&C 90:6 And again, verily I say unto thy brethren, Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams, their sins are forgiven them also, and they are accounted as equal with thee in holding the keys of this last kingdom;

D&C 90:7 As also through your administration the keys of the school of the prophets, which I have commanded to be organized;

D&C 90:8 That thereby they may be perfected in their ministry for the salvation of Zion, and of the nations of Israel, and of the Gentiles, as many as will believe;

D&C 90:9 That through your administration they may receive the word, and through their administration the word may go forth unto the ends of the earth, unto the Gentiles first, and then, behold, and lo, they shall turn unto the Jews.

D&C 90:10 And then cometh the day when the arm of the Lord shall be revealed in power in convincing the nations, the heathen nations, the house of Joseph, of the gospel of their salvation.

D&C 90:11 For it shall come to pass in that day, that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power, by the administration of the Comforter, shed forth upon them for the revelation of Jesus Christ.

D&C 90:12 And now, verily I say unto you, I give unto you a commandment that you continue in the ministry and presidency.

D&C 90:13 And when you have finished the translation of the prophets, you shall from thenceforth preside over the affairs of the church and the school;

D&C 90:14 And from time to time, as shall be manifested by the Comforter, receive revelations to unfold the mysteries of the kingdom;

D&C 90:15 And set in order the churches, and study and learn, and become acquainted with all good books, and with languages, tongues, and people.

D&C 90:16 And this shall be your business and mission in all your lives, to preside in council, and set in order all the affairs of this church and kingdom.

D&C 90:17 Be not ashamed, neither confounded; but be admonished in all your high-mindedness and pride, for it bringeth a snare upon your souls.

D&C 90:18 Set in order your houses; keep slothfulness and uncleanness far from you.

D&C 90:19 Now, verily I say unto you, let there be a place provided, as soon as it is possible, for the family of thy counselor and scribe, even Frederick G. Williams.

D&C 90:20 And let mine aged servant, Joseph Smith, Sen., continue with his family upon the place where he now lives; and let it not be sold until the mouth of the Lord shall name.

D&C 90:21 And let my counselor, even Sidney Rigdon, remain where he now resides until the mouth of the Lord shall name.

D&C 90:22 And let the bishop search diligently to obtain an agent, and let him be a man who has got riches in store--a man of God, and of strong faith--

D&C 90:23 That thereby he may be enabled to discharge every debt; that the storehouse of the Lord may not be brought into disrepute before the eyes of the people.

D&C 90:24 Search diligently, pray always, and be believing, and all things shall work together for your good, if ye walk uprightly and remember the covenant wherewith ye have covenanted one with another.

D&C 90:25 Let your families be small, especially mine aged servant Joseph Smith's, Sen., as pertaining to those who do not belong to your families;

D&C 90:26 That those things that are provided for you, to bring to pass my work, be not taken from you and given to those that are not worthy--

D&C 90:27 And thereby you be hindered in accomplishing those things which I have commanded you.

D&C 90:28 And again, verily I say unto you, it is my will that my handmaid Vienna Jaques should receive money to bear her expenses, and go up unto the land of Zion;

D&C 90:29 And the residue of the money may be consecrated unto me, and she be rewarded in mine own due time.

D&C 90:30 Verily I say unto you, that it is meet in mine eyes that she should go up unto the land of Zion, and receive an inheritance from the hand of the bishop;

D&C 90:31 That she may settle down in peace inasmuch as she is faithful, and not be idle in her days from thenceforth.

D&C 90:32 And behold, verily I say unto you, that ye shall write this commandment, and say unto your brethren in Zion, in love greeting, that I have called you also to preside over Zion in mine own due time.

D&C 90:33 Therefore, let them cease wearying me concerning this matter.

D&C 90:34 Behold, I say unto you that your brethren in Zion begin to repent, and the angels rejoice over them.

D&C 90:35 Nevertheless, I am not well pleased with many things; and I am not well pleased with my servant William E. McLellin, neither with my servant Sidney Gilbert; and the bishop also, and others have many things to repent of.

D&C 90:36 But verily I say unto you, that I, the Lord, will contend with Zion, and plead with her strong ones, and chasten her until she overcomes and is clean before me.

D&C 90:37 For she shall not be removed out of her place. I, the Lord, have spoken it. Amen.

D&C 91:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, March 9, 1833. The Prophet was at this time engaged in the study of the ancient writings regarded by some as Scripture and known distinctively as the Apocrypha. --These writings not to be accepted as Scripture--Enlightenment of the Spirit requisite to discernment of the truth contained in these books.

D&C 91:1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning the Apocrypha--There are many things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated correctly;

D&C 91:2 There are many things contained therein that are not true, which are interpolations by the hands of men.

D&C 91:3 Verily, I say unto you, that it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be translated.

D&C 91:4 Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him understand, for the Spirit manifesteth truth;

D&C 91:5 And whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom;

D&C 91:6 And whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited. Therefore it is not needful that it should be translated. Amen.

D&C 92:0 Revelation given to Enoch [Joseph Smith the Prophet], at Kirtland, Ohio, March 15, 1833. For explanation of unusual names see heading to Section 78. --Commandment regarding admission to the United Order.

D&C 92:1 Verily, thus saith the Lord, I give unto the united order, organized agreeable to the commandment previously given, a revelation and commandment concerning my servant Frederick G. Williams, that ye shall receive him into the order. What I say unto one I say unto all.

D&C 92:2 And again, I say unto you my servant Frederick G. Williams, you shall be a lively member in this order; and inasmuch as you are faithful in keeping all former commandments you shall be blessed forever. Amen.

D&C 93:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, May 6, 1833. --The Lord defines the relation between himself and the Father--The record of John, the Apostle and Revelator--Jesus Christ the Firstborn--Man was in the beginning with God--The elements are eternal--The glory of God is intelligence--Man innocent in the beginning--Erring ones, even though in high authority in the Church, reproved.

D&C 93:1 Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am;

D&C 93:2 And that I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world;

D&C 93:3 And that I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one--

D&C 93:4 The Father because he gave me of his fulness, and the Son because I was in the world and made flesh my tabernacle, and dwelt among the sons of men.

D&C 93:5 I was in the world and received of my Father, and the works of him were plainly manifest.

D&C 93:6 And John saw and bore record of the fulness of my glory, and the fulness of John's record is hereafter to be revealed.

D&C 93:7 And he bore record, saying: I saw his glory, that he was in the beginning, before the world was;

D&C 93:8 Therefore, in the beginning the Word was, for he was the Word, even the messenger of salvation--

D&C 93:9 The light and the Redeemer of the world; the Spirit of truth, who came into the world, because the world was made by him, and in him was the life of men and the light of men.

D&C 93:10 The worlds were made by him; men were made by him; all things were made by him, and through him, and of him.

D&C 93:11 And I, John, bear record that I beheld his glory, as the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, even the Spirit of truth, which came and dwelt in the flesh, and dwelt among us.

D&C 93:12 And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace;

D&C 93:13 And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness;

D&C 93:14 And thus he was called the Son of God, because he received not of the fulness at the first.

D&C 93:15 And I, John, bear record, and lo, the heavens were opened, and the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove, and sat upon him, and there came a voice out of heaven saying: This is my beloved Son.

D&C 93:16 And I, John, bear record that he received a fulness of the glory of the Father;

D&C 93:17 And he received all power, both in heaven and on earth, and the glory of the Father was with him, for he dwelt in him.

D&C 93:18 And it shall come to pass, that if you are faithful you shall receive the fulness of the record of John.

D&C 93:19 I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know how to worship, and know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness.

D&C 93:20 For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace.

D&C 93:21 And now, verily I say unto you, I was in the beginning with the Father, and am the Firstborn;

D&C 93:22 And all those who are begotten through me are partakers of the glory of the same, and are the church of the Firstborn.

D&C 93:23 Ye were also in the beginning with the Father; that which is Spirit, even the Spirit of truth;

D&C 93:24 And truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come;

D&C 93:25 And whatsoever is more or less than this is the spirit of that wicked one who was a liar from the beginning.

D&C 93:26 The Spirit of truth is of God. I am the Spirit of truth, and John bore record of me, saying: He received a fulness of truth, yea, even of all truth;

D&C 93:27 And no man receiveth a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments.

D&C 93:28 He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things.

D&C 93:29 Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.

D&C 93:30 All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence.

D&C 93:31 Behold, here is the agency of man, and here is the condemnation of man; because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them, and they receive not the light.

D&C 93:32 And every man whose spirit receiveth not the light is under condemnation.

D&C 93:33 For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy;

D&C 93:34 And when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy.

D&C 93:35 The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even temples; and whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy that temple.

D&C 93:36 The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.

D&C 93:37 Light and truth forsake that evil one.

D&C 93:38 Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God.

D&C 93:39 And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers.

D&C 93:40 But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.

D&C 93:41 But verily I say unto you, my servant Frederick G. Williams, you have continued under this condemnation;

D&C 93:42 You have not taught your children light and truth, according to the commandments; and that wicked one hath power, as yet, over you, and this is the cause of your affliction.

D&C 93:43 And now a commandment I give unto you--if you will be delivered you shall set in order your own house, for there are many things that are not right in your house.

D&C 93:44 Verily, I say unto my servant Sidney Rigdon, that in some things he hath not kept the commandments concerning his children; therefore, first set in order thy house.

D&C 93:45 Verily, I say unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., or in other words, I will call you friends, for you are my friends, and ye shall have an inheritance with me--

D&C 93:46 I called you servants for the world's sake, and ye are their servants for my sake--

D&C 93:47 And now, verily I say unto Joseph Smith, Jun.--You have not kept the commandments, and must needs stand rebuked before the Lord;

D&C 93:48 Your family must needs repent and forsake some things, and give more earnest heed unto your sayings, or be removed out of their place.

D&C 93:49 What I say unto one I say unto all; pray always lest that wicked one have power in you, and remove you out of your place.

D&C 93:50 My servant Newel K. Whitney also, a bishop of my church, hath need to be chastened, and set in order his family, and see that they are more diligent and concerned at home, and pray always, or they shall be removed out of their place.

D&C 93:51 Now, I say unto you, my friends, let my servant Sidney Rigdon go on his journey, and make haste, and also proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the gospel of salvation, as I shall give him utterance; and by your prayer of faith with one consent I will uphold him.

D&C 93:52 And let my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Frederick G. Williams make haste also, and it shall be given them even according to the prayer of faith; and inasmuch as you keep my sayings you shall not be confounded in this world, nor in the world to come.

D&C 93:53 And, verily I say unto you, that it is my will that you should hasten to translate my scriptures, and to obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man, and all this for the salvation of Zion. Amen.

D&C 94:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, May 6, 1833. --Directions regarding the erection of a house for the work of the Presidency--A printing house to be built--Assignments of certain inheritances.

D&C 94:1 And again, verily I say unto you, my friends, a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall commence a work of laying out and preparing a beginning and foundation of the city of the stake of Zion, here in the land of Kirtland, beginning at my house.

D&C 94:2 And behold, it must be done according to the pattern which I have given unto you.

D&C 94:3 And let the first lot on the south be consecrated unto me for the building of a house for the presidency, for the work of the presidency, in obtaining revelations; and for the work of the ministry of the presidency, in all things pertaining to the church and kingdom.

D&C 94:4 Verily I say unto you, that it shall be built fifty-five by sixty-five feet in the width thereof and in the length thereof, in the inner court.

D&C 94:5 And there shall be a lower court and a higher court, according to the pattern which shall be given unto you hereafter.

D&C 94:6 And it shall be dedicated unto the Lord from the foundation thereof, according to the order of the priesthood, according to the pattern which shall be given unto you hereafter.

D&C 94:7 And it shall be wholly dedicated unto the Lord for the work of the presidency.

D&C 94:8 And ye shall not suffer any unclean thing to come in unto it; and my glory shall be there, and my presence shall be there.

D&C 94:9 But if there shall come into it any unclean thing, my glory shall not be there; and my presence shall not come into it.

D&C 94:10 And again, verily I say unto you, the second lot on the south shall be dedicated unto me for the building of a house unto me, for the work of the printing of the translation of my scriptures, and all things whatsoever I shall command you.

D&C 94:11 And it shall be fifty-five by sixty-five feet in the width thereof and the length thereof, in the inner court; and there shall be a lower and a higher court.

D&C 94:12 And this house shall be wholly dedicated unto the Lord from the foundation thereof, for the work of the printing, in all things whatsoever I shall command you, to be holy, undefiled, according to the pattern in all things as it shall be given unto you.

D&C 94:13 And on the third lot shall my servant Hyrum Smith receive his inheritance.

D&C 94:14 And on the first and second lots on the north shall my servants Reynolds Cahoon and Jared Carter receive their inheritances--

D&C 94:15 That they may do the work which I have appointed unto them, to be a committee to build mine houses, according to the commandment, which I, the Lord God, have given unto you.

D&C 94:16 These two houses are not to be built until I give unto you a commandment concerning them.

D&C 94:17 And now I give unto you no more at this time. Amen.

D&C 95:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, June 1, 1833. --The people are chastened for their neglect in failing to build the house according to prior command--They are yet promised power to build it if they will abide by the Lord's commandments--Provision to be made for the School of the Apostles.

D&C 95:1 Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you whom I love, and whom I love I also chasten that their sins may be forgiven, for with the chastisement I prepare a way for their deliverance in all things out of temptation, and I have loved you--

D&C 95:2 Wherefore, ye must needs be chastened and stand rebuked before my face;

D&C 95:3 For ye have sinned against me a very grievous sin, in that ye have not considered the great commandment in all things, that I have given unto you concerning the building of mine house;

D&C 95:4 For the preparation wherewith I design to prepare mine apostles to prune my vineyard for the last time, that I may bring to pass my strange act, that I may pour out my Spirit upon all flesh--

D&C 95:5 But behold, verily I say unto you, that there are many who have been ordained among you, whom I have called but few of them are chosen.

D&C 95:6 They who are not chosen have sinned a very grievous sin, in that they are walking in darkness at noon-day.

D&C 95:7 And for this cause I gave unto you a commandment that you should call your solemn assembly, that your fastings and your mourning might come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, which is by interpretation, the creator of the first day, the beginning and the end.

D&C 95:8 Yea, verily I say unto you, I gave unto you a commandment that you should build a house, in the which house I design to endow those whom I have chosen with power from on high;

D&C 95:9 For this is the promise of the Father unto you; therefore I command you to tarry, even as mine apostles at Jerusalem.

D&C 95:10 Nevertheless, my servants sinned a very grievous sin; and contentions arose in the school of the prophets; which was very grievous unto me, saith your Lord; therefore I sent them forth to be chastened.

D&C 95:11 Verily I say unto you, it is my will that you should build a house. If you keep my commandments you shall have power to build it.

D&C 95:12 If you keep not my commandments, the love of the Father shall not continue with you, therefore you shall walk in darkness.

D&C 95:13 Now here is wisdom, and the mind of the Lord--let the house be built, not after the manner of the world, for I give not unto you that ye shall live after the manner of the world;

D&C 95:14 Therefore, let it be built after the manner which I shall show unto three of you, whom ye shall appoint and ordain unto this power.

D&C 95:15 And the size thereof shall be fifty and five feet in width, and let it be sixty-five feet in length, in the inner court thereof.

D&C 95:16 And let the lower part of the inner court be dedicated unto me for your sacrament offering, and for your preaching, and your fasting, and your praying, and the offering up of your most holy desires unto me, saith your Lord.

D&C 95:17 And let the higher part of the inner court be dedicated unto me for the school of mine apostles, saith Son Ahman; or, in other words, Alphus; or, in other words, Omegus; even Jesus Christ your Lord. Amen.

D&C 96:0 Revelation given to Enoch [Joseph Smith the Prophet], showing the order of the City or Stake of Zion, Shinehah [Kirtland], at Kirtland, Ohio, June 4, 1833. Given as an ensample to the Saints in Kirtland. For explanation of unusual names see heading to Section 78. The occasion was a conference of High Priests; and the chief subject of consideration was that of certain lands possessed by the Church. --The Kirtland Stake of Zion to be made strong--Admission to the United Order.

D&C 96:1 Behold, I say unto you, here is wisdom, whereby ye may know how to act concerning this matter, for it is expedient in me that this stake that I have set for the strength of Zion should be made strong.

D&C 96:2 Therefore, let my servant Newel K. Whitney take charge of the place which is named among you, upon which I design to build mine holy house.

D&C 96:3 And again, let it be divided into lots, according to wisdom, for the benefit of those who seek inheritances, as it shall be determined in council among you.

D&C 96:4 Therefore, take heed that ye see to this matter, and that portion that is necessary to benefit mine order, for the purpose of bringing forth my word to the children of men.

D&C 96:5 For behold, verily I say unto you, this is the most expedient in me, that my word should go forth unto the children of men, for the purpose of subduing the hearts of the children of men for your good. Even so. Amen.

D&C 96:6 And again, verily I say unto you, it is wisdom and expedient in me, that my servant John Johnson whose offering I have accepted, and whose prayers I have heard, unto whom I give a promise of eternal life inasmuch as he keepeth my commandments from henceforth--

D&C 96:7 For he is a descendant of Joseph and a partaker of the blessings of the promise made unto his fathers--

D&C 96:8 Verily I say unto you, it is expedient in me that he should become a member of the order, that he may assist in bringing forth my word unto the children of men.

D&C 96:9 Therefore ye shall ordain him unto this blessing, and he shall seek diligently to take away incumbrances that are upon the house named among you, that he may dwell therein. Even so. Amen.

D&C 97:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, August 2, 1833. Ten days before this time the corner stones of the Lord's House in Kirtland were laid, after the order of the Holy Priesthood. See History of the Church, vol. 1, p. 400. This revelation deals particularly with the affairs of the Saints in Zion, Jackson County, Missouri. --Many of the Labors of the Saints in Zion are commended--Commendation of the school in Zion--The Lord's will that a house should be built unto him in the land of Zion--Great blessings promised to Zion if her people shall obey this commandment--Zion defined as the pure in heart--Zion to escape the indignation the Lord if the people are faithful, otherwise many calamities to fall upon them.

D&C 97:1 Verily I say unto you my friends, I speak unto you with my voice, even the voice of my Spirit, that I may show unto you my will concerning your brethren in the land of Zion, many of whom are truly humble and are seeking diligently to learn wisdom and to find truth.

D&C 97:2 Verily, verily I say unto you, blessed are such, for they shall obtain; for I, the Lord, show mercy unto all the meek, and upon all whomsoever I will, that I may be justified when I shall bring them unto judgment.

D&C 97:3 Behold, I say unto you, concerning the school in Zion, I, the Lord, am well pleased that there should be a school in Zion, and also with my servant Parley P. Pratt, for he abideth in me.

D&C 97:4 And inasmuch as he continueth to abide in me he shall continue to preside over the school in the land of Zion until I shall give unto him other commandments.

D&C 97:5 And I will bless him with a multiplicity of blessings, in expounding all scriptures and mysteries to the edification of the school, and of the church in Zion.

D&C 97:6 And to the residue of the school, I, the Lord, am willing to show mercy; nevertheless, there are those that must needs be chastened, and their works shall be made known.

D&C 97:7 The ax is laid at the root of the trees; and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire. I, the Lord, have spoken it.

D&C 97:8 Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice--yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command--they are accepted of me.

D&C 97:9 For I, the Lord, will cause them to bring forth as a very fruitful tree which is planted in a goodly land, by a pure stream, that yieldeth much precious fruit.

D&C 97:10 Verily I say unto you, that it is my will that a house should be built unto me in the land of Zion, like unto the pattern which I have given you.

D&C 97:11 Yea, let it be built speedily, by the tithing of my people.

D&C 97:12 Behold, this is the tithing and the sacrifice which I, the Lord, require at their hands, that there may be a house built unto me for the salvation of Zion--

D&C 97:13 For a place of thanksgiving for all saints, and for a place of instruction for all those who are called to the work of the ministry in all their several callings and offices;

D&C 97:14 That they may be perfected in the understanding of their ministry, in theory, in principle, and in doctrine, in all things pertaining to the kingdom of God on the earth, the keys of which kingdom have been conferred upon you.

D&C 97:15 And inasmuch as my people build a house unto me in the name of the Lord, and do not suffer any unclean thing to come into it, that it be not defiled, my glory shall rest upon it;

D&C 97:16 Yea, and my presence shall be there, for I will come into it, and all the pure in heart that shall come into it shall see God.

D&C 97:17 But if it be defiled I will not come into it, and my glory shall not be there; for I will not come into unholy temples.

D&C 97:18 And, now, behold, if Zion do these things she shall prosper, and spread herself and become very glorious, very great, and very terrible.

D&C 97:19 And the nations of the earth shall honor her, and shall say: Surely Zion is the city of our God, and surely Zion cannot fall, neither be moved out of her place, for God is there, and the hand of the Lord is there;

D&C 97:20 And he hath sworn by the power of his might to be her salvation and her high tower.

D&C 97:21 Therefore, verily, thus saith the Lord, let Zion rejoice, for this is Zion--THE PURE IN HEART; therefore, let Zion rejoice, while all the wicked shall mourn.

D&C 97:22 For behold, and lo, vengeance cometh speedily upon the ungodly as the whirlwind; and who shall escape it?

D&C 97:23 The Lord's scourge shall pass over by night and by day, and the report thereof shall vex all people; yea, it shall not be stayed until the Lord come;

D&C 97:24 For the indignation of the Lord is kindled against their abominations and all their wicked works.

D&C 97:25 Nevertheless, Zion shall escape if she observe to do all things whatsoever I have commanded her.

D&C 97:26 But if she observe not to do whatsoever I have commanded her, I will visit her according to all her works, with sore affliction, with pestilence, with plague, with sword, with vengeance, with devouring fire.

D&C 97:27 Nevertheless, let it be read this once to her ears, that I, the Lord, have accepted of her offering; and if she sin no more none of these things shall come upon her;

D&C 97:28 And I will bless her with blessings, and multiply a multiplicity of blessings upon her, and upon her generations forever and ever, saith the Lord your God. Amen.

D&C 98:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, August 6, 1833. --Patience in persecution enjoined--Good to come out of affliction--The constitutional law of the land to be supported by the Saints--Good men to be supported for secular office--The Saints to proclaim peace--Offenders in the Church at Kirtland reproved--The Saints to forgive their enemies--When resistance is justified--The Saints to be blessed if they will forgive their enemies.

D&C 98:1 Verily I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks;

D&C 98:2 Waiting patiently on the Lord, for your prayers have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, and are recorded with this seal and testament--the Lord hath sworn and decreed that they shall be granted.

D&C 98:3 Therefore, he giveth this promise unto you, with an immutable covenant that they shall be fulfilled; and all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good, and to my name's glory, saith the Lord.

D&C 98:4 And now, verily I say unto you concerning the laws of the land, it is my will that my people should observe to do all things whatsoever I command them.

D&C 98:5 And that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before me.

D&C 98:6 Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church, in befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land;

D&C 98:7 And as pertaining to law of man, whatsoever is more or less than this, cometh of evil.

D&C 98:8 I, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are free indeed; and the law also maketh you free.

D&C 98:9 Nevertheless, when the wicked rule the people mourn.

D&C 98:10 Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold; otherwise whatsoever is less than these cometh of evil.

D&C 98:11 And I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall forsake all evil and cleave unto all good, that ye shall live by every word which proceedeth forth out of the mouth of God.

D&C 98:12 For he will give unto the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept; and I will try you and prove you herewith.

D&C 98:13 And whoso layeth down his life in my cause, for my name's sake, shall find it again, even life eternal.

D&C 98:14 Therefore, be not afraid of your enemies, for I have decreed in my heart, saith the Lord, that I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, that you may be found worthy.

D&C 98:15 For if ye will not abide in my covenant ye are not worthy of me.

D&C 98:16 Therefore, renounce war and proclaim peace, and seek diligently to turn the hearts of the children to their fathers, and the hearts of the fathers to the children;

D&C 98:17 And again, the hearts of the Jews unto the prophets, and the prophets unto the Jews; lest I come and smite the whole earth with a curse, and all flesh be consumed before me.

D&C 98:18 Let not your hearts be troubled; for in my Father's house are many mansions, and I have prepared a place for you; and where my Father and I am, there ye shall be also.

D&C 98:19 Behold, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with many who are in the church at Kirtland;

D&C 98:20 For they do not forsake their sins, and their wicked ways, the pride of their hearts, and their covetousness, and all their detestable things, and observe the words of wisdom and eternal life which I have given unto them.

D&C 98:21 Verily I say unto you, that I, the Lord, will chasten them and will do whatsoever I list, if they do not repent and observe all things whatsoever I have said unto them.

D&C 98:22 And again I say unto you, if ye observe to do whatsoever I command you, I, the Lord, will turn away all wrath and indignation from you, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.

D&C 98:23 Now, I speak unto you concerning your families--if men will smite you, or your families, once, and ye bear it patiently and revile not against them, neither seek revenge, ye shall be rewarded;

D&C 98:24 But if ye bear it not patiently, it shall be accounted unto you as being meted out as a just measure unto you.

D&C 98:25 And again, if your enemy shall smite you the second time, and you revile not against your enemy, and bear it patiently, your reward shall be an hundredfold.

D&C 98:26 And again, if he shall smite you the third time, and ye bear it patiently, your reward shall be doubled unto you four-fold;

D&C 98:27 And these three testimonies shall stand against your enemy if he repent not, and shall not be blotted out.

D&C 98:28 And now, verily I say unto you, if that enemy shall escape my vengeance, that he be not brought into judgment before me, then ye shall see to it that ye warn him in my name, that he come no more upon you, neither upon your family, even your children's children unto the third and fourth generation.

D&C 98:29 And then, if he shall come upon you or your children, or your children's children unto the third and fourth generation, I have delivered thine enemy into thine hands;

D&C 98:30 And then if thou wilt spare him, thou shalt be rewarded for thy righteousness; and also thy children and thy children's children unto the third and fourth generation.

D&C 98:31 Nevertheless, thine enemy is in thine hands; and if thou rewardest him according to his works thou art justified; if he has sought thy life, and thy life is endangered by him, thine enemy is in thine hands and thou art justified.

D&C 98:32 Behold, this is the law I gave unto my servant Nephi, and thy fathers, Joseph, and Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham, and all mine ancient prophets and apostles.

D&C 98:33 And again, this is the law that I gave unto mine ancients, that they should not go out unto battle against any nation, kindred, tongue, or people, save I, the Lord, commanded them.

D&C 98:34 And if any nation, tongue, or people should proclaim war against them, they should first lift a standard of peace unto that people, nation, or tongue;

D&C 98:35 And if that people did not accept the offering of peace, neither the second nor the third time, they should bring these testimonies before the Lord;

D&C 98:36 Then I, the Lord, would give unto them a commandment, and justify them in going out to battle against that nation, tongue, or people.

D&C 98:37 And I, the Lord, would fight their battles, and their children's battles, and their children's children's, until they had avenged themselves on all their enemies, to the third and fourth generation.

D&C 98:38 Behold, this is an ensample unto all people, saith the Lord your God, for justification before me.

D&C 98:39 And again, verily I say unto you, if after thine enemy has come upon thee the first time, he repent and come unto thee praying thy forgiveness, thou shalt forgive him, and shalt hold it no more as a testimony against thine enemy--

D&C 98:40 And so on unto the second and third time; and as oft as thine enemy repenteth of the trespass wherewith he has trespassed against thee, thou shalt forgive him, until seventy times seven.

D&C 98:41 And if he trespass against thee and repent not the first time, nevertheless thou shalt forgive him.

D&C 98:42 And if he trespass against thee the second time, and repent not, nevertheless thou shalt forgive him.

D&C 98:43 And if he trespass against thee the third time, and repent not, thou shalt also forgive him.

D&C 98:44 But if he trespass against thee the fourth time thou shalt not forgive him, but shalt bring these testimonies before the Lord; and they shall not be blotted out until he repent and reward thee four-fold in all things wherewith he has trespassed against thee.

D&C 98:45 And if he do this, thou shalt forgive him with all thine heart; and if he do not this, I, the Lord, will avenge thee of thine enemy an hundred-fold;

D&C 98:46 And upon his children, and upon his children's children of all them that hate me, unto the third and fourth generation.

D&C 98:47 But if the children shall repent, or the children's children, and turn to the Lord their God, with all their hearts and with all their might, mind, and strength, and restore four-fold for all their trespasses wherewith they have trespassed, or wherewith their fathers have trespassed, or their father's fathers, then thine indignation shall be turned away;

D&C 98:48 And vengeance shall no more come upon them, saith the Lord thy God, and their trespasses shall never be brought any more as a testimony before the Lord against them. Amen.

D&C 99:0 Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, August, 1832. --Directions to John Murdock concerning his work in the ministry.

D&C 99:1 Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my servant John Murdock--thou art called to go into the eastern countries from house to house, from village to village, and from city to city, to proclaim mine everlasting gospel unto the inhabitants thereof, in the midst of persecution and wickedness.

D&C 99:2 And who receiveth you receiveth me; and you shall have power to declare my word in the demonstration of my Holy Spirit.

D&C 99:3 And who receiveth you as a little child, receiveth my kingdom; and blessed are they, for they shall obtain mercy.

D&C 99:4 And whoso rejecteth you shall be rejected of my Father and his house; and you shall cleanse your feet in the secret places by the way for a testimony against them.

D&C 99:5 And behold, and lo, I come quickly to judgment, to convince all of their ungodly deeds which they have committed against me, as it is written of me in the volume of the book.

D&C 99:6 And now, verily I say unto you, that it is not expedient that you should go until your children are provided for, and sent up kindly unto the bishop of Zion.

D&C 99:7 And after a few years, if thou desirest of me, thou mayest go up also unto the goodly land, to possess thine inheritance;

D&C 99:8 Otherwise thou shalt continue proclaiming my gospel until thou be taken. Amen.
